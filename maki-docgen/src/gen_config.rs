# Configuration

Settings go in `init.lua`, a Lua script that calls `maki.setup()`. Same language as plugins.

Two places, both optional:

- **Global**: `~/.config/maki/init.lua`
- **Project**: `.maki/init.lua` in the active Git checkout, or in the working
  directory outside Git

When both exist, project settings override global ones. Neither file is required.
A project `init.lua` runs only once you trust that folder, see
[Folder Trust](/docs/folder-trust/).

## Example

```lua
maki.setup({{
    ui = {{
        splash_animation = true,
        mouse_scroll_lines = {mouse_scroll},
        theme = \"tokyonight\",
        tool_output_lines = {{
            bash = {tol_bash},
            read = {tol_read},
        }},
    }},
    agent = {{
        max_output_lines = {max_output_lines},
    }},
    provider = {{
        default_model = \"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6\",
        allowed_models = {{ \"anthropic/*\", \"openai/gpt-5\" }},
        excluded_models = {{ \"*/*-preview\" }},
    }},

    storage = {{
        max_log_files = {max_log_files},
    }},
    plugins = {{
        bash = {{ timeout_secs = 180 }},
        index = {{ max_file_size_mb = 4 }},
    }},
}})
```

All fields are optional. Typos in field names cause an error right away.

`provider.allowed_models` is a list of glob patterns for qualified `provider/model-id` specs. `*` also matches `/`, so `opencode/*` includes nested model IDs. When the list is empty or omitted, every model is allowed. `provider.excluded_models` removes matching models after that, so exclusions always win. A project list replaces the matching global list; omit it to inherit or use `{{}}` to clear it. The policy applies to selectors, CLI and API model changes, delegation, and `maki models`.

`maki.setup()` can only be called once per init.lua.

## Directory layout

Maki follows platform directory conventions. On Linux and macOS that is XDG. On Windows, config, data, state, and logs all live under Roaming AppData (Windows has no separate state dir in this layout).

| Purpose | Linux / macOS | Windows |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Config | `~/.config/maki/` | `%APPDATA%\\maki\\` |
| Data | `~/.local/share/maki/` | `%APPDATA%\\maki\\` |
| State | `~/.local/state/maki/` | `%APPDATA%\\maki\\` |
| Logs | `~/.local/logs/maki/` | `%APPDATA%\\maki\\` |
| Cache | `~/.cache/maki/` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\maki\\` |

Config holds `init.lua`, `permissions.toml`, `mcp.toml`, `providers.toml`, and `commands/`. State holds sessions, auth tokens, memories, plans, folder trust, and model-tier overrides. The install script puts the binary under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\maki` on Windows; that is separate from these runtime dirs.

`~/.maki/` (or `%USERPROFILE%\\.maki\\`) is checked as a legacy fallback. If that directory still exists, maki uses it for everything until you migrate.

### Migrating from ~/.maki/

```
maki migrate xdg
```

This safely moves sessions, auth, plans, memories, logs, and preferences to the platform locations above. Where both old and new files exist, they are merged (input history, model tiers, etc.). Nothing is deleted until it has been copied. At the end you get a summary of where everything lives now.

Safe to run more than once.

## Personal Instructions

On top of the project instruction files Maki loads from the git root down to the cwd (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and friends; see [Context](/docs/context/#instruction-files)), you can add:

- `AGENTS.local.md` in any of those project directories for per-directory preferences (gitignored)
- `~/.config/maki/AGENTS.md` for preferences that apply to all projects

All of these are added to the system prompt at the start of every session.

## Memory

The `memory` tool and `/memory` command store small Markdown notes under the state directory, scoped per project:

`…/state/maki/projects/<project-id>/memories/`

(Linux/macOS: `~/.local/state/maki/…`; Windows: `%APPDATA%\\maki\\…`). Use them for non-obvious gotchas and decisions that should survive across sessions. They are separate from skills and from `AGENTS.md`.
