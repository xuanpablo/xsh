# Token Economy

Maki's whole design falls out of one fact about agent loops: the conversation is re-sent to the model on every turn.

```
turn 1   [system + prompt]                      ─► model ─► tool call
turn 2   [system + prompt + result 1]           ─► model ─► tool call
turn 3   [system + prompt + result 1 + 2]       ─► model ─► ...
```

A tool result does not cost its tokens once. It costs them again on every turn until the session ends or history is compacted. `cat` a 2000-line file on turn 2 of a 40-turn session and you pay for it 38 more times. Prompt caching softens the price, not the principle: cache reads still cost, and a bloated context also makes models measurably dumber.

So Maki attacks the two multipliers: how much each step adds to context, and how many steps there are.

## Smaller results

**index instead of read.** The `index` tool returns a tree-sitter skeleton of a source file: imports, types, signatures, line numbers. Usually 70-90% smaller than the file itself. The agent indexes first, then reads only the ranges it needs.

```
read main.rs                 index main.rs
────────────                 ─────────────────────────────
1400 lines in context        60 lines of signatures
                             + read offset=812 limit=40
```

**Subagents as garbage collectors.** A `task` subagent gets its own throwaway context. It can grep, read, and hit dead ends as much as it wants; only its final summary returns to your conversation. The mess is collected when it exits. Model tiers make this cheap too: delegate a search to a weak model at a fraction of the cost, keep the strong model for judgment.

```
main context                subagent context (discarded)
────────────                ────────────────────────────
task("find auth") ───────►  glob, grep ×6, read ×9, ...
                  ◄───────  "JWT middleware, auth.rs:120"
one line stays              ~20k tokens never seen
```

**Deferred MCP tools.** An MCP server with 100 tools would ship 100 definitions in every request. Maki loads a single `tool_search` tool instead; the model searches when it actually needs something and only the matches load. See [MCP](/docs/mcp/#tool-search).

**Truncation everywhere.** Tool output is capped (`agent.max_output_bytes`, `agent.max_output_lines`), overlong grep lines are skipped, and every builtin tool description nags the model to read only what it needs. The nagging works.

**Interrupted work is not wasted.** Press Esc on a long tool, or let its deadline hit, and whatever it printed so far still reaches the model, tagged as partial: bash keeps its streamed lines, `code_execution` the script output, a `task` subagent its half transcript. Otherwise the next turn starts from nothing and you pay to run it all again.

## Fewer round-trips

Every round-trip re-sends the context, so round-trips are the other half of the bill.

**batch** runs independent tool calls in one turn: one request, N results.

**code_execution** goes further: a Python sandbox where tools are async functions. Chained calls, loops, and filtering happen inside the sandbox; only what the script prints enters context.

```
without                          with code_execution
─────────────────────            ─────────────────────────────
glob        → 300 paths          results = gather(read × 300)
read × 300  → 300 files          filter in python
300 turns, every file            print("3 files call foo_v1")
in context forever               1 turn, 1 line in context
```

**Compaction** resets the multiplier when a session runs long: older turns are summarized and dropped. [Context](/docs/context/#when-the-window-fills) has the details.

## The right model per run

Most requests do not need the strongest model. A typo fix and a kernel debugger both bill by the token, and only one of them profits from frontier reasoning.

Set `[agent.router]` in your config and Maki asks a Jev decision endpoint which model a run should use. The request carries a capped summary of your message and the context size. The answer names one model from your `candidates` list, and Maki adopts it when the answer clears `confidence_threshold`. Candidates must share the current provider and thinking support, so a switch never forces a prompt rebuild and your cache stays valid. When the endpoint is slow, unconfigured, or unsure, the run simply keeps its current model.

Routing is on for every run while enabled, including the run after you pick a model yourself. Turn it off when you want your pick to stick. The decision costs a few hundred tokens per run, and routing a small task to a small model pays that back the first turn.

## Watching it work

`/usage` shows the token breakdown of the current session, and `--output-format json` in [Headless Mode](/docs/headless/) reports `total_cost_usd` per run. Cheap is a feature you can measure.

Each turn is priced when it happens and that number is stored with the session. Prices move (DeepSeek, for one, doubles every rate during peak UTC hours), so a total re-priced later would be a guess. What you see is what you were billed.
