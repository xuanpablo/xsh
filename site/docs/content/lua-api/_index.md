# Lua API

Maki plugins are plain Lua files. Everything a plugin can touch lives under
one global table: `maki`. This reference documents every module, function,
and method. It is generated straight from the source code by `maki-docgen`.
For where plugin files live and how to load them, read the
[Plugins guide](/docs/plugins/) first.

The API tries to mirror Neovim as much as possible (`maki.fs`, `maki.uv`,
`maki.treesitter`, `maki.keymap`, `maki.base64`), signatures are kept identical
so code can be copy-pasted between the two without too many modifications.

Plugins run compiled to native code (Luau JIT). If you are debugging a
plugin and want full backtraces, start maki with `--no-jit`: it runs your
Lua on the interpreter with complete debug info instead.

A small plugin looks like this:

```lua
maki.api.register_command({
  name = "greet",
  description = "Say hello from Lua",
  handler = function()
    maki.ui.flash("hello from a plugin!")
  end,
})
```

## How to read this reference

Signatures use Neovim notation: `{path}` is a required argument, `{opts?}`
is optional, and `{...}` is variadic.

One convention to remember: fallible runtime operations return a
`(value, err)` pair instead of throwing. Check `err` before using `value`:

```lua
local text, err = maki.fs.read("config.json")
if err then
  maki.log.error("read failed: " .. err)
  return
end
```

Lua errors are reserved for programmer mistakes, like passing a number where
a string belongs.

## Permissions and plugin.toml {#plugin-permissions}

Sensitive APIs are gated per plugin file, and every gated function's entry in
this reference names the permission it needs. A gated call without its
permission raises `permission denied: '<name>' not granted for this plugin`.

- `fs_read`: reading files, and locating the directories maki keeps them in
- `fs_write`: creating, changing, and removing files
- `net`: outbound network requests
- `run`: starting processes
- `env`: reading the process environment, where secrets live

Grants come from a `plugin.toml` next to the Lua file (for
`~/.config/maki/init.lua` that is `~/.config/maki/plugin.toml`):

```toml
min_maki_version = "0.4.12"

[permissions]
fs_read = true
fs_write = true
net = true
run = true
env = true
```

The rules:

- No `plugin.toml` at all: every permission is denied, and maki logs a
  warning at load time.
- `plugin.toml` exists: permissions default to granted; set a key to
  `false` to revoke it. An empty file grants everything.
- Invalid TOML: everything denied, with a warning in the log.
- A package, or a plugin maki ships, is read the other way round: a key it
  does not name is not requested, so its `plugin.toml` lists everything it
  uses. Only a `plugin.toml` you wrote yourself defaults to granted.
- `net_hosts` narrows `net = true` to a host allowlist, such as
  `["api.acme.com", "*.acme.dev"]`. Without it, `net` reaches any public
  host. A plugin that registers a provider must set it. See
  [Plugin egress](/docs/permissions/#plugin-egress-net-hosts).
- `min_maki_version` is optional and takes a plain semantic version as a lower
  bound, so ranges do not work. When the field is invalid or the running
  version is older, Maki skips the Lua in that directory and warns at startup
  instead of failing. The same floor applies to an installed package, which is
  skipped while the rest keep loading. `--no-plugins` still skips every user
  plugin at once.

## maki {#maki}

The global entry point. Every API lives under this table.

---

### `maki.setup()` {#maki-setup}

```lua
maki.setup({config})
```

Apply your personal configuration. This is only available inside `init.lua` (not in plugins) and can be called at most once. The table accepts the same keys as the Configuration reference.

**Parameters:**

- `{config}` (`table`) Configuration table.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.setup({
model = "opus",
keymaps = false,
})
```

---

### `maki.split()` {#maki-split}

```lua
maki.split({s}, {sep}, {opts?})
```

Split {s} at each occurrence of {sep} and return the pieces as a
list. Mirrors Neovim's `vim.split`, so code using it can be copied
between Neovim and maki. {sep} is a Lua pattern unless `plain` is
set; an empty {sep} splits into single characters.

**Parameters:**

- `{s}` (`string`) String to split.
- `{sep}` (`string`) Separator: a Lua pattern, or literal text with `plain`.
- `{opts?}` (`table?`) Optional settings:
  - `plain` (`boolean?`) treat {sep} as literal text instead of a pattern.
  - `trimempty` (`boolean?`) drop empty pieces from the start and end of the result.

**Returns:** (`table`) List of split pieces.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.split("a,b,c", ",")                   -- { "a", "b", "c" }
maki.split("x*y*z", "*", { plain = true }) -- { "x", "y", "z" }
maki.split("\nhello\nworld\n", "\n", { trimempty = true }) -- { "hello", "world" }
```

---

### `maki.packadd()` {#maki-packadd}

```lua
maki.packadd({name})
```

Load an installed package that is not active.

**Parameters:**

- `{name}` (`string`) Package name.

---

### `maki.defer_fn()` {#maki-defer_fn}

```lua
maki.defer_fn({callback}, {ms})
```

Run {callback} once after {ms} milliseconds. It fires even if the tool
call that scheduled it has ended or was cancelled, which is what a
self-dismissing toast needs. For repeating work, use a
`maki.async.sleep` loop inside `maki.async.spawn`.

You get back a handle. Its `:stop()` cancels a callback that has not
fired yet, which is how you debounce: schedule, then stop and
reschedule on every new event. An error raised by the callback is
logged and dropped, since nobody is waiting for a result.

**Parameters:**

- `{callback}` (`function`) Called with no arguments.
- `{ms}` (`integer`) Delay in milliseconds. Zero fires on the next tick.

**Returns:** ([`maki.Timer`](#maki-Timer)) Handle with `:stop()` to cancel before it fires.

**Example:**

```lua
-- A toast that dismisses itself 4 seconds later:
local buf = maki.ui.buf({ scratch = true })
buf:line("copied!")
local win = maki.ui.open_win(buf, { split = "right", width = 20, height = 3 })
maki.defer_fn(function() win:close() end, 4000)

-- Repaint only after the user has stopped typing for half a second:
local pending
local function repaint_soon()
  if pending then
    pending:stop()
  end
  pending = maki.defer_fn(repaint, 500)
end
```

---

### `maki.notify()` {#maki-notify}

```lua
maki.notify({msg}, {level?}, {opts?})
```

Show a one line notice. By default it goes to `maki.ui.flash`, with
`{opts.title}` in front of the message when you pass one. Without a UI
(`maki -p`, the sdk, ACP), the notice goes to the log.

There is one handler for the whole process. Once a plugin calls
`maki.set_notify_handler`, notices from every plugin go through it.
That is how a UI plugin turns flashes into stacked toasts without
any of the callers knowing about it.

{level} reaches the handler untouched, and the default ignores it.

**Parameters:**

- `{msg}` (`string`) Notice text.
- `{level?}` (`string?`) Optional. Severity name such as "info", "warn" or "error".
- `{opts?}` (`table?`) Optional. `title` (string) labels the notice. Free form otherwise.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.notify("saved!")
maki.notify("build failed", "error", { title = "make" })
```

---

### `maki.set_notify_handler()` {#maki-set_notify_handler}

```lua
maki.set_notify_handler({handler})
```

Install the handler that every `maki.notify` call in the process goes
through, in place of the default flash. Pass `nil` to put the default
back.

The handler runs on the Lua thread, so keep it short and hand real
work to `maki.async.run`. If it raises an error, the error is logged
and the notice falls back to `maki.ui.flash`, so the user still sees
it. Unloading the plugin that installed the handler also restores the
default.

**Parameters:**

- `{handler}` (`function|nil`) Handler `function(msg, level?, opts?)`, or nil.

**Example:**

```lua
local Toast = require("maki.toast")
maki.set_notify_handler(function(msg, level, opts)
  Toast.show(msg, { title = opts and opts.title, level = level })
end)
```


## maki.pack {#maki-pack}

Declare global packages and inspect package state.

`add` is available only in the global `init.lua`. `get` is read-only
and is available in project config and packages.

---

### `maki.pack.add()` {#maki-pack-add}

```lua
maki.pack.add({specs}, {opts?})
```

Declare global packages after the global `init.lua` finishes.

**Parameters:**

- `{specs}` (`table`) Sources or tables with `src`, `name`, `version`, and `data`.
- `{opts?}` (`table?`) `confirm` controls source confirmation. `load` is a

  boolean or a custom loader function.


**Example:**

```lua
maki.pack.add({
  { src = "https://github.com/user/maki-goal", version = "main" },
})
```

---

### `maki.pack.get()` {#maki-pack-get}

```lua
maki.pack.get({names?}, {opts?})
```

Get package state without changing the installed set.

**Parameters:**

- `{names?}` (`table?`) Package names. Omit for all managed packages.
- `{opts?}` (`table?`) Reserved. Omit it.

**Returns:** (`table?`, `string?`) Package records with `spec`, `path`, `rev`, and
  `active`, or nil plus an error when the pack lockfile cannot be read.


## maki.api {#maki-api}

Plugin registration. This is where you tell maki about your tools,
slash commands, and prompt contributions.

Most plugins only need `register_tool` and maybe `register_prompt_hint`.
Call these at the top level of your plugin file (during load).

```lua
maki.api.register_tool({ name = "greet", ... })
maki.api.register_prompt_hint({ slot = "tool_usage", content = "..." })
```

---

### `maki.api.register_tool()` {#maki-api-register_tool}

```lua
maki.api.register_tool({spec})
```

Register a new tool the agent can call. This is the main way plugins add
capabilities to the agent. The tool is queued during plugin load and
committed to the registry once the plugin finishes loading.

Your {spec} table must include a name, a description (the model reads it
to decide when to use the tool), a JSON Schema for the input, and a handler
function. The handler receives `(input, ctx)` and returns either a plain
string or a table with richer output fields.

**Parameters:**

- `{spec}` (`table`) Tool specification:
  - `name` (`string`) Required. ASCII identifier, up to 64 chars ([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*).
  - `description` (`string`) Required. Non-empty description shown to the model.
  - `schema` (`table`) Required. JSON Schema object describing the tool's input parameters.
  - `handler` (`function`) Required. Called with `(input, ctx)` when the tool is invoked.
    Must return a string or a table with any of these fields:
    - `llm_output` (`string`) Text sent to the model.
    - `is_error` (`boolean`) When true, the result is treated as an error.
    - `content` (`string`) Alias for llm_output (legacy).
    - `body` (`BufHandle`) Rich rendered body shown in the UI.
    - `header` (`BufHandle`) One-line header shown before the body.
    - `format` (`string`) "plain" (default), "markdown", or "report".
    - `annotation` (`string`) Short label shown next to the tool call.
    - `written_path` (`string`) Path of a file written by the tool.
    - `diff_path` (`string`) Path for a diff output block.
    - `diff_before` (`string`) Before text of the diff.
    - `diff_after` (`string`) After text of the diff.
    - `image` (`table`) { media_type: string, data: string } base64 image.
    - `state` (`any`) Serializable state forwarded to restore.
  - `audiences` (`string[]`) Which model audiences see the tool. Values: "main", "sub", "all". Default: all audiences.
  - `kind` (`string`) Optional grouping label (e.g. "filesystem").
  - `timeout` (`number`) Execution timeout in seconds. 0 or false disables. Default: inherits agent deadline.
  - `header` (`function`) Optional. Called before execution, returns a string or BufHandle for the one-line header.
  - `restore` (`function`) Optional. Called to re-render a previous tool result. Receives `(tool_name, input, output, ctx)`.
  - `start` (`function`) Optional. Called when the tool call starts, before the handler runs.
  - `describe` (`function`) Optional. Returns a custom description string for the current context.
  - `examples` (`table`) Optional. Array of example input objects for documentation.
  - `permission_scopes` (`string|function`) Field name in schema (string) or `function(input)` returning a list of path scopes that need write permission. Declaring it is what puts the tool in front of the permission prompt, and it requires `permission`.
  - `permission` (`string`) Required with `permission_scopes`. The capability the tool exposes to the model: "fs_read", "fs_write", "net", "run", or "env". Your plugin must hold it, and so must any plugin that pre-approves this tool.
  - `mutable_path` (`string`) Schema field name (type: string) for the primary path the tool writes. Required with `permission = "fs_write"`. Declaring it is what gets the tool, from the dispatcher and never from the handler: serialization of concurrent calls on that file, the stale-read rejection, the plan-mode block, and the permission boundary check.
  - `start_annotation` (`string|table`) Schema field used to annotate the start header with a count (string) or timeout (`{ field, kind="timeout" }`).

**Example:**

```lua
maki.api.register_tool({
  name = "word_count",
  description = "Count words in a file.",
  kind = "read",
  schema = {
    type = "object",
    properties = { path = { type = "string", description = "File path" } },
    required = { "path" },
  },
  handler = function(input)
    local f = io.open(input.path, "r")
    if not f then return { llm_output = "file not found", is_error = true } end
    local n = 0
    for _ in f:read("*a"):gmatch("%S+") do n = n + 1 end
    f:close()
    return tostring(n) .. " words"
  end,
})
```

---

### `maki.api.register_permission_rule()` {#maki-api-register_permission_rule}

```lua
maki.api.register_permission_rule({spec})
```

Declare an agent permission rule for a native tool. Use it to pre-allow
(or pre-deny) tool calls on paths your plugin owns, like a storage
directory outside the working dir, so the user is not prompted for them.

Rules live as long as the plugin is loaded: a reload replaces them, and a
reload that registers none clears the old ones. User config and session
deny rules always win over a plugin allow.

An allow is delegation, not escalation: it needs the `permission` the
target tool declares, so a plugin can only pre-approve what it could
already do itself. A deny needs no permission.

Allows are checked once the plugin finishes loading, so a plugin may
pre-approve a tool it registers itself. One that does not hold up (no such
tool, a tool with no `permission_scopes` that is never checked, or a
permission the plugin lacks) is dropped with a warning in the log while the
rest of the plugin loads. Without the rule the call simply prompts.

**Parameters:**

- `{spec}` (`table`) Rule specification:
  - `tool` (`string`) Required. Native tool name (e.g. "edit", "write").
    MCP tools and the "*" wildcard are not allowed.
  - `scope` (`string`) Required. Scope pattern the rule applies to, e.g.
    "/abs/dir/**" for a directory subtree. An allow whose
    pattern matches every scope ("*", "**", "/*", "/**") is
    refused: name the paths or commands it covers. A deny may
    cover everything.
  - `effect` (`string`) Optional. "allow" (default) or "deny".

**Example:**

```lua
maki.api.register_permission_rule({
  tool = "write",
  scope = notes_dir .. "/**",
})
```

---

### `maki.api.register_command()` {#maki-api-register_command}

```lua
maki.api.register_command({spec})
```

Register a slash-command that appears in the user input bar.

Slash commands let the user trigger plugin actions by typing `/name` in the
input. Use them for interactive workflows that do not need the model, like
browsing memory files or toggling settings.

**Parameters:**

- `{spec}` (`table`) Command specification:
  - `name` (`string`) Required. The command name (e.g. "/hello"; a leading
    slash is added when missing).
  - `description` (`string`) Optional. Short description shown in the command palette.
  - `nargs` (`integer|string`) Optional. How many arguments the command
    takes, spelled like nvim's nargs: 0 (default),
    1, "?" (zero or one), "*" (any number), or "+"
    (one or more). An argument is a whitespace
    separated word. Type more than allowed and the
    command quietly stops matching: the input goes
    to the model as a normal message. Only the upper
    bound is checked, so with "+" you still need to
    handle an empty `opts.args` yourself.
  - `handler` (`function`) Required. Called when the user runs the command,
    with one opts table: `opts.args` is the raw
    argument string (whitespace kept, may be empty)
    and `opts.fargs` is the same split into words.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.api.register_command({
  name = "/hello",
  description = "Say hello",
  handler = function()
    maki.ui.flash("Hello from my plugin!")
  end,
})
```

---

### `maki.api.register_prompt_hint()` {#maki-api-register_prompt_hint}

```lua
maki.api.register_prompt_hint({spec})
```

Add a piece of text to an aggregate prompt slot. Multiple plugins can each
contribute to the same slot, and all contributions are concatenated.

Good for things like tool usage guidelines or extra context that should
appear alongside other plugins' hints. If you need to own the whole slot
(e.g. identity or tone), use `set_prompt` instead.

Throws if you pass a singleton slot name.

A function `content` is called before every run. Its first value goes in
the system prompt, and later changes reach the model as a context update
until the next compaction.

**Parameters:**

- `{spec}` (`table`) Hint specification:
  - `slot` (`string`) Required. Aggregate slot name (e.g. "tool_usage", "general").
  - `content` (`string|function`) Required. Static text, or a `function()` that returns a string. Max 1 MiB.
  - `prompt` (`string|string[]`) Optional. Restrict to specific prompt ids (e.g. "system").

**Example:**

```lua
maki.api.register_prompt_hint({
  slot = "tool_usage",
  content = "- Prefer **grep** over reading entire files.",
})
```

---

### `maki.api.register_options()` {#maki-api-register_options}

```lua
maki.api.register_options({spec})
```

Declare the options your plugin accepts under `plugins.<name>` in
`maki.setup`, and get back what the user set merged with your defaults.
Call it once, at the top level of your plugin file.

An unknown key, a wrong type, or a value below `min` fails the plugin
load with a clear message, so users catch typos right away. Bad specs
fail the load too. The specs also feed the generated configuration docs.

**Parameters:**

- `{spec}` (`table`) Map of option name to a spec table:
  - `default` (`boolean|number|string`) Optional. Used when the user sets nothing. Its Lua type becomes the option type.
  - `type` (`string`) Required when there is no default: "boolean", "integer", "number", or "string".
  - `min` (`number`) Optional. Minimum accepted value, numeric options only.
  - `desc` (`string`) Required. One line shown in the configuration docs.

**Returns:** (`table`) Merged options: the user's value where set, otherwise the default, or nil when neither exists.

**Example:**

```lua
local opts = maki.api.register_options({
  timeout_secs = { default = 120, min = 5, desc = "Kill the command after this many seconds." },
  max_output_lines = { type = "integer", desc = "Override agent.max_output_lines for this tool." },
})
```

---

### `maki.api.set_prompt()` {#maki-api-set_prompt}

```lua
maki.api.set_prompt({spec})
```

Set a singleton prompt slot. Only one plugin owns each singleton slot at a
time, so calling this replaces any previous value from your plugin.

Use this for slots like "identity" or "tone" where a single coherent value
makes more sense than combining fragments. For aggregate slots like
"tool_usage", use `register_prompt_hint` instead.

Throws if you pass an aggregate slot name. A function `content` behaves
as in `register_prompt_hint`.

**Parameters:**

- `{spec}` (`table`) Spec fields mirror `register_prompt_hint`:
  - `slot` (`string`) Required. Singleton slot name (e.g. "identity", "tone").
  - `content` (`string|function`) Required. Static text or a `function()` returning a string. Max 1 MiB.
  - `prompt` (`string|string[]`) Optional. Restrict to specific prompt ids.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.api.set_prompt({
  slot = "tone",
  content = "Be concise. No filler words.",
})
```

---

### `maki.api.get_tools()` {#maki-api-get_tools}

```lua
maki.api.get_tools({opts?})
```

Return a list of all registered tools. Useful for building UI that shows
available tools or for checking which tools are enabled.

Each entry has the tool's name, schema, audiences, and an `enabled` flag.
Describe callbacks are not invoked (the static description is used).

**Parameters:**

- `{opts?}` (`table?`) Options:
  - `config` (`table`) Optional config table with a `disabled_tools` string[] field used to compute the `enabled` flag on each entry.

**Returns:** (`table[]`) Array of tool entries: { name, schema, audiences, kind?, enabled }.

**Example:**

```lua
local tools = maki.api.get_tools()
for _, t in ipairs(tools) do
  print(t.name, t.enabled)
end
```

---

### `maki.api.get_tool()` {#maki-api-get_tool}

```lua
maki.api.get_tool({name})
```

Look up a single tool by name. Returns its metadata table or nil if the
tool does not exist. For Lua-registered tools the returned table also
includes `header` and `restore` handle functions (wrapped so they never
throw).

**Parameters:**

- `{name}` (`string`) Exact tool name.

**Returns:** (`table|nil`) Tool entry with fields { name, schema, audiences, kind?, header?, restore? }, or nil if not found.

**Example:**

```lua
local t = maki.api.get_tool("bash")
if t then
  print("bash audiences:", table.concat(t.audiences, ", "))
end
```

---

### `maki.api.run_command()` {#maki-api-run_command}

```lua
maki.api.run_command({cmdline})
```

Runs a slash command by name, exactly as typing it in the input would.
Works for built-ins, custom `/project:` and `/user:` commands, MCP
prompts, and commands other plugins registered.

Use it to alias a command you like under a name you prefer, instead of
reimplementing what it does. See `maki.ui.action` for the same idea
applied to keybound UI actions.

Pass the whole command line, arguments included: `"/cd ~/src"`. The
leading slash is optional. Names match exactly apart from case, so a typo
reports an error instead of running the closest command, and a cycle of
aliases stops with one too.

This returns as soon as the command has been dispatched, not when it
finishes, so aliasing something long-running like `/compact` does not
block your handler.

**Parameters:**

- `{cmdline}` (`string`) Command line, e.g. `"/new"` or `"/cd ~/src"`.

**Returns:** (`boolean|nil`, `string|nil`) `true` once dispatched, or nil and an error message for an unknown command.

**Example:**

```lua
-- /resume as an alias for the built-in session picker:
maki.api.register_command({
  name = "/resume",
  description = "Alias for /sessions",
  handler = function()
    local ok, err = maki.api.run_command("/sessions")
    if not ok then
      maki.ui.flash("could not run /sessions: " .. err)
    end
  end,
})
```

---

### `maki.api.create_autocmd()` {#maki-api-create_autocmd}

```lua
maki.api.create_autocmd({event}, {opts})
```

Listen for one or more events. Returns an id you can pass to
`del_autocmd` later to remove the listener.

Built-in events fired by the host: `"TurnStart"`, `"TurnEnd"`,
`"TurnError"`, `"ToolStart"`, `"ToolDone"`, `"AutoCompacting"`,
`"CompactionDone"`, `"PlanReady"`, `"SessionReset"`, `"SessionEnd"`,
`"SessionFocusChanged"`, `"SessionStatusChanged"`, `"SessionTitleChanged"`,
`"TaskStatusChanged"`, `"TaskFocusChanged"`, `"ModelChanged"`, `"InputChanged"`,
and `"FileIndexReady"`. Plugins can also fire their own events with
`exec_autocmds`.

Every host event carries `data.session_id` except `"FileIndexReady"`,
which is about a directory rather than a session. For `"SessionReset"` and
`"SessionEnd"` that is the session being left behind, the other events
name the session now running or focused. What each event adds:

- `"ToolStart"`, `"ToolDone"`: `data.tool_id` and `data.tool`.
- `"ToolDone"` adds `data.is_error` and `data.bytes`, the size of the
  text the model reads. A call that ran also carries `data.duration_ms`
  and `data.input`, the input after every `tool.*.input` layer. A call
  that never ran, like a cancelled one, has neither.
- `"TurnStart"`: `data.text`, the message that started the turn.
- `"TurnEnd"`: `data.reason` (`"finished"`, `"max_tokens"`,
  `"max_turns"`, `"cancelled"`, or `"dropped"` when an
  `agent.user_message` layer refused the message), `data.usage` (four
  token fields, cache included), `data.cost`, `data.list_cost`, `data.context_size`,
  `data.context_window`, and `data.num_turns` (model round-trips the
  turn took). `list_cost` is the un-subsidised list price and `cost` is
  the real bill, so a budget plugin charges against whichever one it
  wants.
- `"AutoCompacting"`: `data.context_size` and `data.context_window` at
  trigger time.
- `"CompactionDone"`: `data.context_size_before`,
  `data.context_size_after`, `data.context_window`, and `data.summary`,
  the text that replaced the history.
- `"PlanReady"`: `data.path`, the absolute path of the plan file the
  agent just wrote. Fires once per draft. Plan state is per session, so
  pass `data.session_id` to `maki.plan.read`.
- `"SessionFocusChanged"`: `data.previous_session_id`, absent on the
  first focus at startup.
- `"SessionStatusChanged"`: `data.status` (`"working"`, `"needs_input"`,
  or `"idle"`), `data.title`, and `data.focused` (boolean).
- `"SessionTitleChanged"`: `data.title` and `data.focused` (boolean),
  when the title changes (rename or auto-generation).
- `"TaskStatusChanged"`: `data.id`, `data.name`, and `data.status`
  (`"working"`, `"done"`, or `"error"`), when a subagent starts or
  changes status. A task that comes back from disk already finished
  stays quiet, so reloading a session does not replay old tasks.
- `"TaskFocusChanged"`: `data.id`, the task now on screen (`"main"` or a
  subagent's id, what `ctx:task_id()` reports inside a tool). Fires for
  the chat cycling keys, `maki.task.focus`, and a session switch that
  lands on another task.
- `"ModelChanged"`: `data.model` in the shape `maki.model.get` returns,
  plus `data.previous_spec`. Picking the model already in use stays
  quiet, and so does startup.
- `"InputChanged"`: `data.text`, `data.cursor` and `data.version`, the
  chat input as `maki.ui.input` reports it. `data.source` is the plugin
  name when that plugin's `maki.ui.input_edit` was the only writer this
  frame, and nil otherwise (including when the user moved the caret), so
  ignoring your own name never drops a change. `data.cursor_only` is true
  when only the caret moved. Handlers that only care about the text
  should return early on it. Fires at most once per frame, and only when
  the text or caret changed. Focusing another session republishes that
  session's input.
- `"FileIndexReady"`: `data.root`, the absolute directory that was
  walked, `data.files`, how many paths the walk left, and `data.crashed`
  and `data.truncated`, the two ways that list is not the whole tree.
  Fires once per walk that ends, whatever `maki.fs.fuzzy_files` or the
  `Ctrl+S` picker started it, so a plugin ranking files asks again
  instead of polling. A walk cancelled before it ended stays quiet.
  `data.root` is absent for a directory with no UTF-8 spelling, and so is
  the `root` of the call that asked for the walk, so a plugin matching
  the two takes an event without a root as a reason to ask again. Asking
  again only ever re-reads the root the plugin passed.

`"TurnEnd"` fires once per turn and only for the main session, so
subagent turns never show up. A manual `/compact` ends its run without
ending a turn, so it stays quiet too.

Drivers are not all caught up. `"TurnStart"` and `"PlanReady"` come from
`maki-ui` only. `maki-acp` runs the agent on its own loop and does not
call the dispatcher yet, so plugins loaded under ACP receive no turn
events. Everything else fires under `maki -p` and sdk mode as well.

`"SessionEnd"` is the teardown signal: it fires first so handlers can
still inspect or stop the session's jobs, then session-owned jobs are
reaped. `data.reason` names the path it came from: `"reset"` (TUI
`/new`), `"load"`, `"delete"` (tab closed), `"shutdown"`, `"reload"`
(`/reload` is rebuilding the plugin host, and the session carries on in
the new one), `"replaced"` (an ACP client took the session's place), or
`"completed"` (a headless run finished).

On `"shutdown"`, `"reload"`, `"replaced"`, and `"completed"` the host is
already tearing down, so the UI is detached (`maki.fn` roundtrips fail
right away) and every handler shares one grace period. `data.deadline_ms`
is how much of it is left at dispatch, so write state out with `maki.fs`
and do not park. On the other reasons nothing waits and `data.deadline_ms`
is nil.

`"SessionReset"` stays TUI-only (`/new`) and fires on the same path as
`"SessionEnd"` with `reason = "reset"`.

Jobs started inside a callback die with the dispatch unless you await
them there (`jobwait`) or hand them to a session
(`scope = { session = ... }`).

**Parameters:**

- `{event}` (`string|string[]`) Event name or list of names.
- `{opts}` (`table`) Options:
  - `callback` (`function`) called with an ev table `{ id, event, match, data }`.
  - `once` (`boolean`) remove the handler after it fires once (default false).
  - `pattern` (`string|string[]`) only fire when the pattern matches. `"*"` matches everything. Omit to match all.

**Returns:** (`integer`) Autocmd id.

**Example:**

```lua
local id = maki.api.create_autocmd("TurnEnd", {
  callback = function(ev)
    print("turn ended: " .. ev.event)
  end,
})
```

---

### `maki.api.del_autocmd()` {#maki-api-del_autocmd}

```lua
maki.api.del_autocmd({id})
```

Remove a previously registered autocmd. Does nothing if the {id}
does not exist.

**Parameters:**

- `{id}` (`integer`) Id returned by `create_autocmd`.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.api.del_autocmd(id)
```

---

### `maki.api.exec_autocmds()` {#maki-api-exec_autocmds}

```lua
maki.api.exec_autocmds({event}, {opts?})
```

Fire one or more events manually. Every matching autocmd callback
runs to completion before this function returns.

A handler may suspend, so this call may too.

**Parameters:**

- `{event}` (`string|string[]`) Event name or list of names to fire.
- `{opts?}` (`table?`) Options:
  - `pattern` (`string`) passed to callbacks as `ev.match`.
  - `data` (`any`) arbitrary value passed as `ev.data`.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.api.exec_autocmds("MyEvent", {
  pattern = "init",
  data = { msg = "hello" },
})
```

---

### `maki.api.declare_slot()` {#maki-api-declare_slot}

```lua
maki.api.declare_slot({name}, {default}, {opts?})
```

Create a named extension point owned by your plugin. You provide a
{default} function, and other plugins can wrap it with layers using
`set_slot`. The returned callable runs the full chain: outermost layer
first, then inward, ending at {default}.

{opts} prices what a layer from another plugin pays to steer your chain.
You set it, because you are the only one who knows what your default does
with the arguments it is handed. Pass `{ capability = { "net" } }` to
charge the permissions you name, all of them at once; `{ capability = {} }`
to let anyone layer for free, which is the honest price for a slot whose
arguments are inert; or leave {opts} out to charge every permission, what a
tool declaring no capability charges. You can only name permissions your
own plugin holds.

Throws if another plugin already owns a slot with the same {name}, or
if {name} starts with `"tool."`, `"ui."`, or `"agent."`, which the host
fires itself. The name stays yours across an unload: nobody else can take it over, or
re-declare it cheaper, while maki runs.

The chain is async: the default and every layer may park (`maki.fs.*`,
`maki.fn.jobwait`, `maki.agent.call_tool`, ...), and so does the
returned callable. Call it from a tool handler, a command, or an
autocmd, rather than from a `header` or `restore` function, which
cannot wait. The chain runs in your task, so cancelling the caller
cancels the layers it is waiting on.

**Parameters:**

- `{name}` (`string`) Unique slot name, e.g. `"myplugin.render"`.
- `{default}` (`function`) Default implementation, called when no layers wrap it.
- `{opts?}` (`table|nil`) `{ capability = { "net", ... } }`: what a layer from another plugin pays.

**Returns:** (`function`) Callable that dispatches through all layers.

**Example:**

```lua
-- anyone may layer this one: it only uppercases the text it is given
local render = maki.api.declare_slot("myplugin.render", function(text)
  return text:upper()
end, { capability = {} })
print(render("hello")) -- HELLO
```

---

### `maki.api.set_slot()` {#maki-api-set_slot}

```lua
maki.api.set_slot({name}, {wrapper})
```

Add a layer around an existing (or future) slot. Layers wrap the
default from the outside in. Each layer receives `prev` as its
first argument. Call `prev(...)` to continue down the chain.
Calling `prev` more than once throws.

You can call this before the owner runs `declare_slot`. The layer
is queued and attached when the slot is declared.

A layer may park, and one that throws is skipped: the chain continues
as if it had returned `prev(...)` untouched, so a broken layer never
takes the seam down with it.

Layers wrap in registration order, so the last one registered runs
first and sees the value before the others do.

Maki fires two slots around the plan form, both with
`ev = { path, session }`. `ui.plan_form.actions` asks for the form's
menu, and `ui.plan_form` asks whether the form opens at all. Both are
documented under [maki.plan](/docs/lua-api/#maki-plan).

Maki fires two slots per tool itself: `tool.<name>.input` before
permissions look at the call, and `tool.<name>.output` on the text it
produced. Both take `function(prev, value, ctx)` and answer with a
table to replace the value, nothing to leave it alone, or
`nil, reason` to stop the call. An input layer can also answer
`value, { ask = reason }` to make the user approve the call. Name the
tool `*` (`tool.*.input`) to wrap every tool. Wrapping one costs the
capability the tool declares, and a tool declaring none costs every
permission.

The agent loop fires `agent.user_message`, `agent.stop`,
`agent.compact.before`, and `agent.compact.prepare`, with the same
contract. Wrapping one costs every permission. See
[Hooks](/docs/hooks/).

Wrapping a slot another plugin declared steers a chain that plugin's
callers trust, so it costs whatever the owner priced it at in
`declare_slot`: the capabilities it named, every permission if it named
none, or nothing at all if it declared its arguments inert. Layering a slot
you declared yourself is free. Like the `tool.*` slots, this is decided
when the chain fires: the call skips a layer that is not entitled and
carries on, and a reload that changes what you hold takes effect on the
next call.

**Parameters:**

- `{name}` (`string`) Slot name to wrap.
- `{wrapper}` (`function`) Layer: `function(prev, ...)`. Call `prev(...)` to continue.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.api.set_slot("myplugin.render", function(prev, text)
  return prev("[" .. text .. "]")
end)
```

---

### `maki.api.get_slots()` {#maki-api-get_slots}

```lua
maki.api.get_slots()
```

List all known slots and their current state. Useful for debugging
which plugins own or wrap each slot.

`capability` is the list of permissions a layer from another plugin pays,
and is absent on a slot whose owner named no price, which costs every
permission.

**Returns:** (`table`) Map of slot name to `{ owner, declared, fillers, capability }`.

**Example:**

```lua
for name, info in pairs(maki.api.get_slots()) do
  print(name, info.owner, info.declared)
end
```


## maki.plan {#maki-plan}

Plan-mode surface for plugins.

Read the plan, and shape the plan form by layering the two slots maki
fires around it. Plan state is per session, so every call takes an
optional `session` and defaults to the focused tab.

`ui.plan_form.actions` is the menu. The default answers with the
built-in rows, each `{ id, label, desc, action }`, and a layer
appends, reorders or drops them before returning the list. Every row
needs an `id` no other row uses, since that is how a later layer finds
it. Anything past the 32nd row is dropped.

A row carrying a `handler` has that function called on the Lua thread
with `{ session, path, parallel }` when the user picks it. The row's
`action` runs after the handler returns, unless the handler returned
`false` or failed, so copying a built-in row and adding a handler
keeps the built-in outcome. Drop the `action` to replace it.

`ui.plan_form` is the form itself. A layer that answers `false` keeps
it closed and renders the plan however it likes.

Layering either slot costs every permission, the price of steering a
call whose reach nobody declared: a row decides what pressing Enter
does, up to a build-mode turn with every tool behind it.

Unloading your plugin hands the form back and reaps its row handlers.

```lua
-- A row of your own, next to the built-in ones:
maki.api.set_slot("ui.plan_form.actions", function(prev, ev)
  local rows = prev(ev)
  table.insert(rows, {
    id = "commit_and_implement",
    label = "Commit and implement",
    desc = "Commit the plan file first, then implement it",
    handler = function(opts)
      maki.fn.system({ "git", "commit", "-am", "plan" })
      maki.session.set_mode("build", { session = opts.session })
      maki.session.prompt("Implement " .. opts.path, { session = opts.session })
    end,
  })
  return rows
end)

-- Render the plan yourself for as long as this plugin is loaded:
maki.api.set_slot("ui.plan_form", function(prev, ev)
  local plan = maki.plan.read({ session = ev.session })
  return false
end)
```

---

### `maki.plan.read()` {#maki-plan-read}

```lua
maki.plan.read({opts?})
```

Read the current plan state. Returns `{ mode, path, content, ready }`:
- `mode` is `"plan"` or `"build"`.
- `path` is the absolute plan path once the session has one, else `nil`.
- `ready` is `true` once the agent has written the plan file.
- `content` is the file contents, `nil` when the plan is not ready or the
  read failed.

**Parameters:**

- `{opts?}` (`table?`) `session` (string?) Session id, defaults to focused.

**Returns:** (`table|nil`, `string|nil`) Plan snapshot table, or nil and an error.

**Example:**

```lua
local plan, err = maki.plan.read({ session = id })
if plan and plan.ready then
  print(plan.path, plan.content)
end
```


## maki.agent {#maki-agent}

Subagent primitives for plugins that need to talk to an LLM.

This module gives you the building blocks: resolve which model to use,
build a system prompt, list available tools, call a tool directly, or
open a full session with its own conversation history.

Policy like retries, validation, and concurrency lives in the calling
plugin, not here.

```lua
local tools = maki.agent.tools(ctx, { audience = "general_sub" })
local sess = maki.agent.session(ctx, {
  system = "You are a helpful assistant.",
  tools = tools,
})
local r = sess:prompt("Hello!")
print(r.text)
sess:close()
```

---

### `maki.agent.resolve_model()` {#maki-agent-resolve_model}

```lua
maki.agent.resolve_model({ctx}, {opts?})
```

Look up the model that the current agent is using, or pick a cheaper one.
You might want a cheaper model for simple subtasks (summaries, classification)
without hard-coding a model name.

The returned table has fields: `id` (string), `tier` (string),
`provider` (string), `spec` (string).

**Parameters:**

- `{ctx}` (`LuaCtx`) Agent context.
- `{opts?}` (`table?`) Optional fields:
  - `tier` (`string?`) target tier, e.g. `"fast"`, `"mid"`, `"best"`. Clamped to
    the parent tier so you cannot escalate.
  - `spec` (`string?`) exact model spec string, e.g. `"claude-3-5-haiku-20241022"`.
    Takes precedence over `tier`.

**Returns:** (`table?`, `string?`) Model table on success, or `(nil, err)` on failure.

**Example:**

```lua
local model, err = maki.agent.resolve_model(ctx, { tier = "fast" })
if err then error(err) end
print(model.spec, model.tier)
```

---

### `maki.agent.system_prompt()` {#maki-agent-system_prompt}

```lua
maki.agent.system_prompt({ctx}, {opts})
```

Build a system prompt from a built-in template. Environment variables like
`{cwd}` are substituted automatically. Use this when you need a ready-made
prompt for a subagent session.

**Parameters:**

- `{ctx}` (`LuaCtx`) Agent context.
- `{opts}` (`table`) Required fields:
  - `prompt_id` (`string`) one of `"research"`, `"general"`, `"system"`.

  Optional fields:

  - `instructions` (`string|boolean?`) extra text appended to the prompt.
    `true` loads instructions from the project `.maki/instructions` file.
    `false` or nil omits them.

**Returns:** (`string?`, `string?`) The assembled prompt string, or `(nil, err)` on failure.

**Example:**

```lua
local prompt, err = maki.agent.system_prompt(ctx, {
  prompt_id = "research",
  instructions = true,
})
if err then error(err) end
```

---

### `maki.agent.tools()` {#maki-agent-tools}

```lua
maki.agent.tools({ctx}, {opts})
```

Get the list of tool definitions for a given audience. Pass the result
straight into `maki.agent.session()` or use it to inspect what tools are
available.

**Parameters:**

- `{ctx}` (`LuaCtx`) Agent context.
- `{opts}` (`table`) Required fields:
  - `audience` (`string`) tool audience filter, e.g. `"general"`, `"subagent"`,
    `"general_sub"`.

  Optional fields:

  - `only` (`string[]?`) include only these tool names.
  - `except` (`string[]?`) exclude these tool names.
  - `workflow` (`boolean?`) use workflow-mode descriptions. Default: `false`.
  - `spec` (`string?`) evaluate capability exclusions against this model spec.
  - `mcp` (`boolean?`) describe tools as if MCP is reachable. Default: `true`.
    Pass what you pass to `maki.agent.session()`. Otherwise the descriptions
    advertise MCP tools that the session has no way to call.

**Returns:** (`table?`, `string?`) Array of tool definition tables, or `(nil, err)` on failure.

**Example:**

```lua
local defs, err = maki.agent.tools(ctx, {
  audience = "general_sub",
  except = { "bash", "write" },
})
if err then error(err) end
print(#defs .. " tools available")
```

---

### `maki.agent.callable_tools()` {#maki-agent-callable_tools}

```lua
maki.agent.callable_tools({ctx})
```

Every tool name this context can dispatch: registry tools, MCP tools
(deferred ones included), host tools (ACP client tools, a subagent's
`structured_output`) and `tool_search`. Reach for it when you expose tools
inside a sandbox and need the names to bind. `maki.api.get_tools()` covers
the registry alone and has no view of the session.

The list already accounts for this session's audience, the config's
`disabled_tools` and the model's capabilities. Read `audiences` to layer
your own policy on top. A sandbox wants `interpreter`.

Each name shows up once, described by the tool a call would really reach, so
a host tool that shadows a registry name reports its own audience rather
than the shadowed one's.

**Parameters:**

- `{ctx}` (`LuaCtx`) Agent context.

**Returns:** (`table?`, `string?`) Array of `{ name, alias?, source, audiences, schema? }`,
  or `(nil, err)` on failure. `source` is one of `"native"`, `"local"`,
  `"mcp"`. `alias` is a safe identifier to bind, set only when `name` is not
  one (say `srv__get-docs`). Dispatch `name` in every case. `schema` comes
  with registry tools only.

**Example:**

```lua
local tools, err = maki.agent.callable_tools(ctx)
if err then error(err) end
for _, t in ipairs(tools) do
  print(t.source, t.alias or t.name)
end
```

---

### `maki.agent.call_tool()` {#maki-agent-call_tool}

```lua
maki.agent.call_tool({ctx}, {name}, {input}, {opts?})
```

Run a tool by name and wait for the result. This is how you call built-in
tools (like `read`, `bash`, `glob`) from Lua without going through the LLM.

Live events (streaming output, annotations, cumulative usage) are delivered
through optional callbacks while the tool runs.

**Parameters:**

- `{ctx}` (`LuaCtx`) Agent context.
- `{name}` (`string`) Tool name, e.g. `"bash"`, `"read"`.
- `{input}` (`table|any`) Tool input (JSON-serializable). Must match the tool's `input_schema`.
- `{opts?}` (`table?`) Optional fields:
  - `timeout` (`integer?`) deadline in seconds.
  - `on_live_buf` (`function?`) called with a `BufHandle` for each live buffer
    the tool publishes. Must not yield.
  - `on_annotation` (`function?`) called with an annotation string for each
    annotation event. Must not yield.
  - `on_usage` (`function?`) called with a formatted cumulative token usage
    string. Must not yield.

**Returns:** (`string?`, `string?`) Tool output text, or `(nil, err)` on failure.
  Instruction files the child picks up (a subdirectory `AGENTS.md`) are
  not in the text: they land on the calling tool's own result.

**Example:**

```lua
local out, err = maki.agent.call_tool(ctx, "bash", {
  command = "ls -la",
  timeout = 10,
})
if err then error(err) end
print(out)
```

---

### `maki.agent.session()` {#maki-agent-session}

```lua
maki.agent.session({ctx}, {opts})
```

Create a new subagent session. The session inherits the parent model and
MCP handle unless you override them. You get back a `Session` object that
you can send messages to with `:prompt()`.

This is the main way to spin up a sub-conversation with its own history
and tool set.

**Parameters:**

- `{ctx}` (`LuaCtx`) Agent context.
- `{opts}` (`table`) Optional fields:
  - `model_spec` (`string?`) model spec string to use instead of the parent model.
  - `system` (`string?`) system prompt. Defaults to empty.
  - `tools` (`table?`) tool definitions array (from `maki.agent.tools()`).
  - `local_tools` (`table?`) map of `name -> spec` for Lua-backed tools. Each spec
    requires `description` (string), `input_schema` (table), and
    `handler` (function). The handler receives the input table and must return
    `(string)` or `(nil, err)`. Optional `audiences` (string[]) gates who may
    call it, the same way `maki.api.register_tool` does. The default is the
    model alone, so a script cannot reach it through `code_execution`.
  - `name` (`string?`) display name for logs and UI.
  - `seed` (`table?`) array of `{ role, text }` transcript entries
    (`role` is `"user"` or `"assistant"`) the session opens with, instead
    of a blank history. Text only: flatten tool calls into the text
    yourself. Default: no seed.
  - `fork_last` (`integer?`) open with the text of the parent session's
    last N messages instead of a blank history or `seed`. Tool calls and
    results are flattened out; consecutive same-role entries merge.
  - `audience` (`string?`) tool audience for capability gating. Default: `"general_sub"`.
  - `mcp` (`boolean?`) give the session access to MCP tools. Their
    definitions are injected automatically each turn (deferred behind
    `tool_search`), so don't put MCP definitions in `tools`. The session
    starts with no loaded tools of its own. Default: `true`.
  - `thinking` (`string|integer?`) thinking mode: `"off"`, `"adaptive"`, an
    effort level (`"minimal"`, `"low"`, `"medium"`, `"high"`, `"xhigh"`,
    `"max"`), or a budget integer (token count). Inherits the parent
    setting if omitted, and is capped at it otherwise.
  - `fast` (`boolean?`) use fast mode. Inherits parent setting if omitted.

**Returns:** ([`Session?`](#maki-agent-Session), `string?`) Session handle, or `(nil, err)` on failure.

**Example:**

```lua
local tools = maki.agent.tools(ctx, { audience = "general_sub" })
local sess, err = maki.agent.session(ctx, {
  system = "You are a research assistant.",
  tools = tools,
  name = "researcher",
})
if err then error(err) end

-- Close before handling the error, so no path leaves the session open.
local result, prompt_err = sess:prompt("Summarize this file.")
sess:close()
if prompt_err then error(prompt_err) end
```


## maki.agent.Session {#maki-agent-Session}

A subagent session with its own conversation history.

Create one with `maki.agent.session()`, then send messages with
`:prompt()`. The session remembers previous turns, so you can have
a multi-step conversation.

Always call `:close()` when you are done, on error paths too. The
garbage collector is a fallback that may never run while the VM sits
idle, so a session you only drop can stay open for the rest of the run.

---

### `Session:prompt()` {#Session-prompt}

```lua
Session:prompt({message})
```

Send a message to the subagent and wait for its full response. The agent
loop runs to completion, calling tools as needed. Conversation history is
kept across calls, so you can have a multi-turn conversation.

The returned table has fields: `text` (string), `duration_ms` (integer),
`input_tokens` (integer), `output_tokens` (integer). `text` is an empty
string when the subagent produced no text block (e.g. it only called
tools).

**Parameters:**

- `{message}` (`string`) User message to send.

**Returns:** (`table?`, `string?`) Result table on success, or `(nil, err)` on
failure. A run cut short after streaming some text hands you both: the
error and a `{ text = <what it streamed> }` table.

**Example:**

```lua
local r, err = sess:prompt("What files are in this project?")
if err then error(err) end
print(r.text)
print(r.input_tokens .. " input, " .. r.output_tokens .. " output tokens")
```

---

### `Session:close()` {#Session-close}

```lua
Session:close()
```

Close the session and flush its history back to the parent agent. Calling
it more than once is safe.

Close on every path, error paths included. Dropping the session instead
leaves the work to the Lua garbage collector, which may never run while
the VM sits idle, and the subagent's event relay stays alive until it does.


## maki.async {#maki-async}

Tools for running things concurrently in Lua plugins.

`run` starts a background task that ends with its caller, and `spawn`
one that lives as long as the plugin. `gather` and `join` run several
functions at once, and `semaphore` limits how many. `await` and `wrap`
turn callback APIs into coroutine calls.

```lua
local results = maki.async.gather({
  function() return fetch("a.txt") end,
  function() return fetch("b.txt") end,
})
```

---

### `maki.async.run()` {#maki-async-run}

```lua
maki.async.run({fn}, {on_finish?})
```

Start {fn} as a background task without waiting for it. Pass
{on_finish} to get the result. The task is cancelled with its caller
and stopped after 60 seconds. For work that outlives the caller, use
`maki.async.spawn`.

**Parameters:**

- `{fn}` (`function`) Zero-argument function to execute.
- `{on_finish?}` (`function?`) Optional callback `function(err, result)`. Called once {fn} completes.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.async.run(function()
  local data = expensive_fetch()
  process(data)
end)
```

---

### `maki.async.spawn()` {#maki-async-spawn}

```lua
maki.async.spawn({fn})
```

Run {fn} in a task that lives as long as your plugin, such as a
repeating timer or a connection opened at load.

The task has no deadline and outlives the call that started it, so a
tool handler can spawn it and return. It ends when {fn} returns or
raises, when you call `task:cancel()`, or when the plugin unloads.
Errors are logged and flashed with the plugin name.

Spawned at the top level of a plugin file, it starts after the plugin
loads. It does not keep maki alive: `maki -p` drops it on exit.

Code that runs 5 seconds without yielding is still stopped. See
`maki.async.sleep`.

**Parameters:**

- `{fn}` (`function`) Zero-argument function to run.

**Returns:** ([`maki.async.Task`](#maki-async-Task)) Handle with `:cancel()`.

**Example:**

```lua
local task = maki.async.spawn(function()
  while true do
    maki.async.sleep(2000)
    report()
  end
end)

task:cancel()
```

---

### `maki.async.sleep()` {#maki-async-sleep}

```lua
maki.async.sleep({ms})
```

Suspend the calling task for {ms} milliseconds. Other tasks and the UI
keep running, and a cancel still lands while you sleep.

All plugins share one Lua thread. Code that runs for 5 seconds without
yielding is stopped with an error. `sleep(0)` lets every other ready
task run once, then returns. Call it now and then in long loops.

A repeating timer is a sleep loop inside `maki.async.spawn`. For a
one-shot timer that outlives the tool call, such as a toast that
dismisses itself, use `maki.defer_fn`.

**Parameters:**

- `{ms}` (`integer`) Milliseconds to sleep. Zero only yields.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.async.run(function()
  maki.async.sleep(4000)
  win:close()
end)

-- A long loop that keeps the rest of maki responsive:
for i, line in ipairs(lines) do
  if i % 1000 == 0 then
    maki.async.sleep(0)
  end
  process(line)
end
```

---

### `maki.async.await()` {#maki-async-await}

```lua
maki.async.await({argc}, {fn}, {...})
```

Turn a callback-based function into a normal call you can use in a coroutine. It calls `fn(..., callback)`, inserting the callback at position {argc}, then suspends your coroutine until the callback fires. You get back whatever the callback was called with.

**Parameters:**

- `{argc}` (`integer`) Total number of positional arguments {fn} expects (including the callback). Must be >= 1.
- `{fn}` (`function`) Callback-based function to call.
- `{...}` (`any`) Extra arguments forwarded to {fn} before the injected callback.

**Returns:** (`...`) Values passed by the caller to the injected callback.

**Example:**

```lua
local result = maki.async.await(2, http.get, url)
```

---

### `maki.async.wrap()` {#maki-async-wrap}

```lua
maki.async.wrap({argc}, {fn})
```

Create a coroutine-friendly wrapper around a callback-based function. The wrapper calls `maki.async.await` for you, so you can use the result like a normal function call.

**Parameters:**

- `{argc}` (`integer`) Callback position, forwarded to `maki.async.await`.
- `{fn}` (`function`) Callback-based function to wrap.

**Returns:** (`function`) Wrapped function you can call like a normal function.

**Example:**

```lua
local get = maki.async.wrap(2, http.get)
local body = get(url)
```

---

### `maki.async.join()` {#maki-async-join}

```lua
maki.async.join({max_jobs}, {fns})
```

Run all functions in {fns} with at most {max_jobs} going at once. Waits until every function has finished. Unlike `gather`, this does not return individual results.

**Parameters:**

- `{max_jobs}` (`integer`) Maximum number of functions running at the same time.
- `{fns}` (`table`) Array of zero-argument functions to execute.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.async.join(4, {
  function() process(files[1]) end,
  function() process(files[2]) end,
  function() process(files[3]) end,
})
```

---

### `maki.async.gather()` {#maki-async-gather}

```lua
maki.async.gather({fns})
```

Run all functions in {fns} at the same time and collect their results.
Unlike `join`, this gives you back the return value (or error) from each
function. The results are in the same order as the input.

Each entry in the result array has `ok` (boolean), and either `value`
(on success) or `err` (string, on failure).

**Parameters:**

- `{fns}` (`table`) Array of zero-argument functions.

**Returns:** (`table`) Array of result tables, one per function.

**Example:**

```lua
local results = maki.async.gather({
  function() return fetch("a.txt") end,
  function() return fetch("b.txt") end,
})
for i, r in ipairs(results) do
  if r.ok then print(r.value) else print("error: " .. r.err) end
end
```

---

### `maki.async.semaphore()` {#maki-async-semaphore}

```lua
maki.async.semaphore({n})
```

Create a counting semaphore that allows at most {n} concurrent permits.
Use this to limit how many tasks hit a resource at the same time.

**Parameters:**

- `{n}` (`integer`) Maximum number of concurrent permits. Values below 1 are clamped to 1.

**Returns:** ([`maki.async.Semaphore`](#maki-async-Semaphore)) A new semaphore.

**Example:**

```lua
local sem = maki.async.semaphore(5)
-- each task acquires a permit before doing work
local permit = sem:acquire()
do_work()
permit:release()
```

---

### `maki.async.on_cancel()` {#maki-async-on_cancel}

```lua
maki.async.on_cancel({fn})
```

Register {fn} to run as soon as the current task is cancelled or hits
its deadline, without waiting for whatever it is doing to finish. Use
it to paint the cancelled state: a handler waiting on children
(`gather`, `call_tool`) stays parked until they wind down, so anything
after the wait is too late to reach the screen.

The callback receives the reason (`"cancelled"` or `"timeout"`) and may
still call `ctx:finish`; the host prefers that reply over the generic
cancelled/timeout error. Mark it `is_error = true` and end it with a
marker, so the model knows the output it gets is cut short.

The callback runs outside your coroutine, so it must not yield. It
fires at most once, immediately if the task is already cancelled. An
error inside it is logged and never reaches your handler, and the
other hooks still run.

**Parameters:**

- `{fn}` (`function`) Function to run on cancel; receives the reason string.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.async.on_cancel(function(reason)
  view:append({ { reason, "tool_error" } })
  ctx:finish({ llm_output = partial .. "\n[cancelled; output is partial]", is_error = true })
end)
maki.async.gather(children)
```


## maki.async.Semaphore {#maki-async-Semaphore}

A counting semaphore for limiting how many tasks run at once.

Create one with `maki.async.semaphore(n)`, then call `:acquire()` to
get a permit before doing work. If the task is cancelled, the acquire
is cancelled too.

---

### `Semaphore:acquire()` {#Semaphore-acquire}

```lua
Semaphore:acquire()
```

Wait for a permit from the semaphore. Your coroutine suspends until a slot
opens up. If the owning task is cancelled, the acquire is cancelled too.

**Returns:** ([`maki.async.Permit`](#maki-async-Permit)) A permit handle. Call `:release()` when done, or let it be garbage collected.

**Example:**

```lua
local sem = maki.async.semaphore(3)
local permit = sem:acquire()
-- do work that needs the slot
permit:release()
```


## maki.async.Permit {#maki-async-Permit}

One slot in a semaphore, obtained from `Semaphore:acquire()`.

The slot is held until you call `:release()` or until the permit is
garbage collected. Releasing early lets other tasks acquire sooner.

---

### `Permit:release()` {#Permit-release}

```lua
Permit:release()
```

Give the permit back to the semaphore so another task can acquire it.
Throws if you already released this permit.


## maki.async.Task {#maki-async-Task}

Handle returned by `maki.async.spawn`.

---

### `Task:cancel()` {#Task-cancel}

```lua
Task:cancel()
```

Stop the task. A task that is waiting ends right away and runs its
`maki.async.on_cancel` hooks. A task that cancels itself stops at its
next yield. Extra calls do nothing.


## maki.base64 {#maki-base64}

Base64 encoding and decoding, modelled after `vim.base64`.

Both functions accept strings and Luau buffers, so you can round-trip
binary data read with `maki.fs.read_bytes`.

```lua
local encoded = maki.base64.encode("hello")
local decoded = maki.base64.decode(encoded)
```

---

### `maki.base64.encode()` {#maki-base64-encode}

```lua
maki.base64.encode({data})
```

Encode {data} to standard Base64. Like `vim.base64.encode`.
Accepts both strings and Luau buffers.

**Parameters:**

- `{data}` (`string|buffer`) Data to encode.

**Returns:** (`string`) Base64-encoded string.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.base64.encode("hello") -- "aGVsbG8="
```

---

### `maki.base64.decode()` {#maki-base64-decode}

```lua
maki.base64.decode({str})
```

Decode a Base64-encoded {str} back to its original bytes. Like `vim.base64.decode`.

**Parameters:**

- `{str}` (`string|buffer`) Base64-encoded text.

**Returns:** (`string?`, `string?`) Decoded bytes as a string, or nil plus an error
  message if {str} is not valid Base64.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.base64.decode("aGVsbG8=") -- "hello"
```


## maki.env {#maki-env}

Paths to maki's own directories (config, state, logs, legacy).

Use these to locate config files or persistent state without hard-coding paths.

These answer where maki keeps its files, so they need `fs_read`, which a
plugin needs to read anything there anyway. Asking for a path must not
cost a plugin `env`, which covers the process environment alone
(`maki.uv.os_getenv`), where secrets live.

```lua
local cfg = maki.env.config_dir()
```

---

### `maki.env.state_dir()` {#maki-env-state_dir}

```lua
maki.env.state_dir()
```

Return the directory where maki stores runtime state (sessions, auth tokens, etc.).
Typically something like `~/.local/state/maki`.

Requires the `fs_read` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Returns:** (`string?`) State directory path, or nil if it cannot be determined.

**Example:**

```lua
local dir = maki.env.state_dir()
```

---

### `maki.env.config_dir()` {#maki-env-config_dir}

```lua
maki.env.config_dir()
```

Return the directory where maki looks for user configuration files.
Typically something like `~/.config/maki`.

Requires the `fs_read` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Returns:** (`string?`) Config directory path, or nil if it cannot be determined.

**Example:**

```lua
local dir = maki.env.config_dir()
```

---

### `maki.env.logs_dir()` {#maki-env-logs_dir}

```lua
maki.env.logs_dir()
```

Return the directory where maki writes its log files (`maki.log`).
Typically something like `~/.local/logs/maki`.

Requires the `fs_read` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Returns:** (`string?`) Logs directory path, or nil if it cannot be determined.

**Example:**

```lua
local dir = maki.env.logs_dir()
```

---

### `maki.env.legacy_dir()` {#maki-env-legacy_dir}

```lua
maki.env.legacy_dir()
```

Return the legacy config path (`~/.maki`), if it exists on disk.
Useful for migration logic. Returns nil when there is no legacy directory.

Requires the `fs_read` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Returns:** (`string?`) Legacy directory path, or nil if not present.


## maki.fn {#maki-fn}

Process and environment helpers, modeled after Neovim's `vim.fn` job
control. Use these to run shell commands, wait for output, and check
whether programs are installed.

```lua
local id = maki.fn.jobstart("git status", {
  on_exit = function(_, code) print("done: " .. code) end,
})
```

---

### `maki.fn.jobstart()` {#maki-fn-jobstart}

```lua
maki.fn.jobstart({cmd}, {opts?})
```

Run a command in the background. A string runs through `bash -c` on Unix
or `cmd /C` on Windows; a table is spawned as argv, with no shell in
between (nothing in it can be read as a redirect, a pipe, or `$(...)`).
You get back a job id that you can pass to `jobstop` or `jobwait` to
control the process.

`stdout` and `stderr` route a stream to a file instead of into maki. A
path is opened for append and handed to the child, so nothing is buffered
here: no callback, no tail, no events for that stream, and it counts as
truncated everywhere a tail is reported. That makes the two mutually
exclusive with `on_stdout` / `on_stderr` for the same stream, and a path
additionally needs the `fs_write` permission. To both persist and react,
run one job writing the file and a second one tailing it.

Requires the `run` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Parameters:**

- `{cmd}` (`string|table`) Shell command, or an argv table like

  `{ "tail", "-F", path }`.

- `{opts?}` (`table?`) Optional settings:
  - `cwd` (`string?`) working directory (tilde is expanded).
  - `env` (`table?`) extra environment variables, `{ VAR = "value" }`.
  - `on_stdout` (`function?`) called with `(job_id, line)` for each stdout line.
  - `on_stderr` (`function?`) called with `(job_id, line)` for each stderr line.
  - `on_exit` (`function?`) called with `(job_id, code)` when the process finishes.
  - `stdout` (`string|false?`) append stdout to this path, or `false` to
    discard it.
  - `stderr` (`string|false?`) same for stderr; both may name one path.
  - `sandbox` (`string?`) `"workspace_write"` confines the job: reads allowed

  everywhere, writes only in `cwd` and tmp. Fails closed when no backend


  is usable (macOS `sandbox-exec`, Linux `bwrap`).

  - `scope` (`string|table?`) job lifetime. `"task"` (default) ends the job
    with the current call. `"plugin"` keeps it alive until the plugin
    unloads or reloads. `{ session = "<id>" }` keeps it alive until that
    session ends, and survives plugin reload.
  - `tail` (`integer?`) trailing lines per stream kept for `jobinfo`
    (default 20, 0 disables, max 1024).
  - `name` (`string?`) handle for `jobfind`, unique among the live jobs this
    plugin can see. Starting a second job under a live name is an error.

**Returns:** (`integer?`, `string?`) Job id, or nil plus an error message when the
  process could not start (binary not found, bad `cwd`, redirect file not
  writable).

**Example:**

```lua
local id, err = maki.fn.jobstart({ "rg", "--json", pattern, dir }, {
  on_stdout = function(_, line) print(line) end,
  on_exit = function(_, code) print("exit: " .. code) end,
})
if not id then
  maki.log.warn("rg failed to start: " .. err)
end
```

---

### `maki.fn.jobstop()` {#maki-fn-jobstop}

```lua
maki.fn.jobstop({job_id})
```

Kill a running job immediately (SIGKILL on Unix). Safe to call on
jobs that already exited or on unknown ids.

Requires the `run` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Parameters:**

- `{job_id}` (`integer`) Job id returned by `jobstart`.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.fn.jobstop(id)
```

---

### `maki.fn.jobforget()` {#maki-fn-jobforget}

```lua
maki.fn.jobforget({job_id})
```

Drop an exited session-owned job from the store. Running jobs are left
alone; use `jobstop` to kill those. Unknown ids are a no-op.

Requires the `run` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Parameters:**

- `{job_id}` (`integer`) Job id returned by `jobstart`.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.fn.jobforget(id)
```

---

### `maki.fn.jobwait()` {#maki-fn-jobwait}

```lua
maki.fn.jobwait({job_id}, {timeout_ms?})
```

Wait for a job to finish and collect its output. Returns a result
table with `stdout`, `stderr`, `exit_code`, and `truncated`. A job that
already exited answers from its captured tail, so `truncated` says
whether that tail ever lost a line (`tail` too small or 0, or the stream
redirected away). Waiting on a live job collects every line and is never
truncated.

While waiting, the job's `on_stdout`, `on_stderr`, and `on_exit`
callbacks fire as events arrive (like Neovim), so you can stream
output into a buffer while parked here. An already-exited
session-owned job answers from its snapshot and fires no callbacks.
Task and plugin jobs leave the store on exit, so waiting after that
answers nil plus an error.

Requires the `run` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Parameters:**

- `{job_id}` (`integer`) Job id returned by `jobstart`.
- `{timeout_ms?}` (`integer?`) Maximum wait in milliseconds (default 30000).

**Returns:** (`table?`, `string?`) `{ stdout, stderr, exit_code, truncated }`, or
  nil plus an error on timeout or an unknown job.

**Example:**

```lua
local id = maki.fn.jobstart("echo hello")
local result, err = maki.fn.jobwait(id, 5000)
if result then
  print(result.stdout)
end
```

---

### `maki.fn.jobinfo()` {#maki-fn-jobinfo}

```lua
maki.fn.jobinfo({job_id})
```

Snapshot a job this plugin can see. Live jobs report tails collected
so far; session-owned jobs still answer after they exit.

Requires the `run` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Parameters:**

- `{job_id}` (`integer`) Job id returned by `jobstart`.

**Returns:** (`table|nil`, `string|nil`) `{ id, command, name, pid, session, status,
  exit_code, elapsed_secs, stdout_lines, stderr_lines }`, or nil and
  an error. `status` is `"running"` or `"exited"`.

**Example:**

```lua
local info = maki.fn.jobinfo(id)
```

---

### `maki.fn.joblist()` {#maki-fn-joblist}

```lua
maki.fn.joblist({session?})
```

List jobs this plugin can see, including exited session-owned jobs (so an
id started before a reload stays findable). Rows identify the job; call
`jobinfo` for tails. Pass a session id to list only that session's jobs.
Plugin and task jobs carry no session, so a filter never matches them.

Requires the `run` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Parameters:**

- `{session?}` (`string?`) Session id filter.

**Returns:** (`table`) array of `{ id, command, name, pid, session, status,
  exit_code, elapsed_secs }`.

**Example:**

```lua
local jobs = maki.fn.joblist(maki.session.current())
```

---

### `maki.fn.jobattach()` {#maki-fn-jobattach}

```lua
maki.fn.jobattach({job_id}, {opts})
```

Attach (or replace) callbacks on a job this plugin can see. This is how a
plugin picks its jobs back up after a reload: unloading drops the Lua
callbacks of its session-owned jobs, but the processes keep running.

Keys absent from {opts} leave the current callback alone. Attaching
`on_exit` to a job that already exited still fires it once, with the
recorded exit code, so a reload racing the exit cannot lose it.

Requires the `run` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Parameters:**

- `{job_id}` (`integer`) Job id, e.g. from `joblist`.
- `{opts}` (`table`) `on_stdout`, `on_stderr`, `on_exit`: a function, or `false` to clear.

**Returns:** (`boolean|nil`, `string|nil`) true on success, or nil and an error.

**Example:**

```lua
-- A monitor that survives /reload: adopt the live job or start one.
local sid = maki.session.current()
local id = maki.fn.jobfind("log-tail")
  or maki.fn.jobstart({ "tail", "-F", path }, {
    name = "log-tail",
    scope = { session = sid },
  })
maki.fn.jobattach(id, {
  on_stdout = function(_, line) maki.session.notify(line, { session = sid }) end,
  on_exit = function(_, code) maki.session.notify("tail died: " .. code, { session = sid }) end,
})
```

---

### `maki.fn.jobfind()` {#maki-fn-jobfind}

```lua
maki.fn.jobfind({name})
```

Find the live job of this plugin that `jobstart` registered under {name}.
An exited job never answers, so `jobfind(...) or jobstart(...)` restarts a
job that died instead of adopting its id. The name stays on the `joblist`
row, which is where you go to see why it died.

Requires the `run` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Parameters:**

- `{name}` (`string`) Name passed to `jobstart`.

**Returns:** (`integer|nil`, `string|nil`) Job id, or nil and an error when no live
  job holds the name.

**Example:**

```lua
local id = maki.fn.jobfind("log-tail")
if not id then
  id = maki.fn.jobstart("tail -F /tmp/log", { name = "log-tail", scope = "plugin" })
end
```

---

### `maki.fn.executable()` {#maki-fn-executable}

```lua
maki.fn.executable({name})
```

Check whether {name} can be found on `$PATH` or is an absolute path
to a file. Returns 1 when found, 0 otherwise (matches Neovim's
`vim.fn.executable`).

Requires the `fs_read` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Parameters:**

- `{name}` (`string`) Program name (e.g. `"git"`) or absolute path.

**Returns:** (`integer`) `1` if found, `0` otherwise.

**Example:**

```lua
if maki.fn.executable("rg") == 1 then
  -- use ripgrep
end
```

---

### `maki.fn.winsaveview()` {#maki-fn-winsaveview}

```lua
maki.fn.winsaveview()
```

Read the viewport of the focused chat transcript, like Neovim's
`vim.fn.winsaveview()`. The transcript is the only scrollable window
maki has, so there is no window argument.

`topline` is the 1-based transcript line at the top of the viewport, so
the last visible one is `math.min(topline + height - 1, line_count)`.
`auto_scroll` has no Vim counterpart: it is true while the transcript
follows streaming output.

**Returns:** (`table|nil`, `string|nil`) `{topline, line_count, height, auto_scroll}`, or nil and an error.

**Example:**

```lua
local view = maki.fn.winsaveview()
maki.fn.winrestview({ topline = view.topline + 1 })
```

---

### `maki.fn.winrestview()` {#maki-fn-winrestview}

```lua
maki.fn.winrestview({view})
```

Scroll the focused chat transcript so that the `topline` field of
{view} becomes the top visible line, like Neovim's
`vim.fn.winrestview()`. Out of range values are clamped. Other keys are
ignored, so a table straight from `winsaveview()` round-trips.

Scrolling away from the bottom unpins the transcript; landing back at
the bottom re-pins it so streaming output keeps following.

**Parameters:**

- `{view}` (`table`) View to restore. Only `topline` (1-based) is read.

**Returns:** (`boolean|nil`, `string|nil`) true on success, or nil and an error.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.fn.winrestview({ topline = 1 })
```


## maki.fs {#maki-fs}

File-system utilities, modelled after `vim.fs` and `vim.uv`.

Fallible operations return `(value, err)` pairs and never throw.
Paths support `~/` expansion. Relative paths resolve from the current working directory.

```lua
local text, err = maki.fs.read("init.lua")
if err then return end
```

---

### `maki.fs.read()` {#maki-fs-read}

```lua
maki.fs.read({path})
```

Read the entire file at {path} as a UTF-8 string.
Files over 512 MiB or not valid UTF-8 return nil plus an error message.
Use `read_bytes` for binary files.

Requires the `fs_read` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Parameters:**

- `{path}` (`string`) Absolute or relative file path. `~/` is expanded to the home directory.

**Returns:** (`string?`, `string?`) File contents, or nil plus an error message.

**Example:**

```lua
local text, err = maki.fs.read("config.toml")
if err then
  maki.log.warn("could not read config: " .. err)
  return
end
```

---

### `maki.fs.read_bytes()` {#maki-fs-read_bytes}

```lua
maki.fs.read_bytes({path})
```

Read the entire file at {path} as raw bytes, returned as a Luau buffer.
Files larger than 512 MiB return nil plus an error message.
Useful for binary files or when you need to pass the data to `maki.base64.encode`.

Requires the `fs_read` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Parameters:**

- `{path}` (`string`) Absolute or relative file path. `~/` is expanded to the home directory.

**Returns:** (`buffer?`, `string?`) File bytes as a Luau buffer, or nil plus an error message.

**Example:**

```lua
local buf, err = maki.fs.read_bytes("image.png")
if err then return end
local encoded = maki.base64.encode(buf)

### `maki.fs.root()` {#maki-fs-root}

```lua
maki.fs.root({source}, {marker})
```

Walk upward from {source} looking for a directory that contains one of the
{marker} files or directories. Like `vim.fs.root`. Useful for finding the

```

---

### `maki.fs.dir()` {#maki-fs-dir}

```lua
maki.fs.dir({path}, {opts?})
```

List the contents of the directory at {path}.
Each entry is a two-element array `{name, type}` where type is one of
`"file"`, `"directory"`, `"link"`, or `"unknown"`. Follows symlinks.

Requires the `fs_read` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Parameters:**

- `{path}` (`string`) Directory path.
- `{opts?}` (`table?`) `depth` (integer, default 1): how many levels deep to recurse.

**Returns:** (`table?`, `string?`) Array of `{name, type}` entries, or nil plus an error message.

end
```

---

### `maki.fs.write()` {#maki-fs-write}

```lua
maki.fs.write({path}, {content})
```

Write {content} to the file at {path}, creating it if it does not exist
or overwriting it if it does. The write is atomic: readers see either the
old file or the complete new one. Existing file permissions are preserved;
new files are owner-only on Unix.

Requires the `fs_write` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Parameters:**

- `{path}` (`string`) Destination file path. `~/` is expanded.
- `{content}` (`string`) Text to write.

**Returns:** (`true?`, `string?`) `true` on success, or nil plus an error message.

local ok, err = maki.fs.write("out.txt", "hello world")
if err then print("write failed: " .. err) end
```

---

### `maki.fs.append()` {#maki-fs-append}

```lua
maki.fs.append({path}, {content})
```

Append {content} to the file at {path}, creating it (but not its parent
directory) if it does not exist.

Requires the `fs_write` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Parameters:**

- `{path}` (`string`) Destination file path. `~/` is expanded.
- `{content}` (`string`) Text to append.

**Returns:** (`true?`, `string?`) `true` on success, or nil plus an error message.

**Example:**

local ok, err = maki.fs.append("out.log", "line\n")
if err then print("append failed: " .. err) end
```

---

### `maki.fs.atomic_write()` {#maki-fs-atomic_write}

```lua
maki.fs.atomic_write({path}, {content})
```

Atomically replace {path} with {content}. The parent directory must exist.
Readers observe either the old file or the complete new file.
Existing file permissions are preserved. On Unix, new files use mode 0600.

Requires the `fs_write` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Parameters:**

- `{path}` (`string`) Destination file path. `~/` is expanded.
- `{content}` (`string`) Text to write.

**Returns:** (`true?`, `string?`) `true` on success, or nil plus an error message.

**Example:**

```lua
local ok, err = maki.fs.atomic_write("state.json", encoded)
if err then print("atomic write failed: " .. err) end
```

---

### `maki.fs.rm()` {#maki-fs-rm}

```lua
maki.fs.rm({path}, {opts?})
```

Delete the file, symlink, or directory at {path}.
Pass `recursive = true` to remove a non-empty directory tree (like `rm -r`).
Unlike `vim.fs.rm`, this also removes an empty directory without `recursive`.
Symlinks are removed themselves, never followed.

Requires the `fs_write` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Parameters:**

- `{path}` (`string`) Path to the file or directory to remove.
- `{opts?}` (`table?`) `recursive` (boolean, default false): remove a directory and its contents recursively. `force` (boolean, default false): silently ignore a missing path.

**Returns:** (`true?`, `string?`) `true` on success, or nil plus an error message.

**Example:**

```lua
local ok, err = maki.fs.rm("temp.txt")
if err then print("rm failed: " .. err) end
maki.fs.rm("stale_dir", { recursive = true, force = true })
```

---

### `maki.fs.mkdir()` {#maki-fs-mkdir}

```lua
maki.fs.mkdir({path}, {opts?})

intermediate directories, like `mkdir -p`.

Requires the `fs_write` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Parameters:**

- `{path}` (`string`) Directory path to create.
- `{opts?}` (`table?`) `parents` (boolean, default false): create intermediate parent directories.

**Returns:** (`true?`, `string?`) `true` on success, or nil plus an error message.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.fs.mkdir("a/b/c", { parents = true })
```

---

### `maki.fs.glob()` {#maki-fs-glob}

```lua
maki.fs.glob({pattern}, {opts?})
```

Find files matching one or more glob patterns, walked fresh on every call.

Reads any path the plugin is allowed to read and keeps nothing afterwards.
`maki.fs.fuzzy_files` ranks a walk the host caches instead, which is
cheaper per keystroke but only covers the current working directory.

Respects `.gitignore` by default. Pass `sort = "mtime"` to get the most
recently modified files first.

Requires the `fs_read` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Parameters:**

- `{pattern}` (`string|string[]`) Glob pattern or array of patterns.
- `{opts?}` (`table?`) `path` (string): search root. `limit` (integer): max results. `gitignore` (boolean, default true): respect .gitignore. `sort` (string): `"mtime"` sorts newest first.

**Returns:** (`string[]?`, `string?`) Array of absolute file paths, or nil plus an error message.

**Example:**

```lua
local files, err = maki.fs.glob("**/*.lua", { path = "plugins", limit = 10 })
if err then return end
for _, f in ipairs(files) do print(f) end
```

---

### `maki.fs.grep()` {#maki-fs-grep}

```lua
maki.fs.grep({pattern}, {opts?})
```

Search file contents for a regex {pattern}. Returns structured matches
grouped by file, similar to ripgrep output.

Each result entry has a `path` and a list of `groups`. Each group contains
`lines`, where every line has `line_nr`, `text`, and `is_match`.

Requires the `fs_read` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Parameters:**

- `{pattern}` (`string`) Regular expression to search for.
- `{opts?}` (`table?`) `path` (string): search root. `include` (string): file glob filter (e.g. `"*.rs"`). `context_before` / `context_after` (integer): context lines around matches. `limit` (integer): max match groups. `max_line_bytes` (integer): skip lines longer than this.

**Returns:** (`table?`, `string?`) Array of `{path, groups}` tables, or nil plus an error message.

**Example:**

```lua
local hits, err = maki.fs.grep("TODO", { path = "src", include = "*.rs", limit = 5 })
if err then return end
for _, file in ipairs(hits) do
  for _, g in ipairs(file.groups) do
    for _, line in ipairs(g.lines) do
      if line.is_match then print(file.path .. ":" .. line.line_nr) end
    end
  end
end
```

---

### `maki.fs.fuzzy_files()` {#maki-fs-fuzzy_files}

```lua
maki.fs.fuzzy_files({opts?})
```

Rank the files and directories under {opts.path} against {opts.query} and
return the best ones, best first, with the state of the walk behind them.

The host walks each root once and shares that walk with the built-in file
picker (`Ctrl+S`), so a call ranks an existing list instead of walking the
tree, and both rank alike. Use `maki.fs.glob` for patterns, a path outside
the cwd, or a tree read fresh right now. Only `limit` items ever cross into
Lua whatever the size of the repo, paths come back relative to the root
with a trailing separator on the directories, and `.gitignore` and `.git`
are respected. `highlights` cost a second matcher pass, so ask for them
only to draw matches.

`complete` is false while a walk is filling the list, so an empty `items`
means "not found yet" and asking again is worth it. maki walks a bounded
number of trees at once, so a first call can also answer before the walk it
asked for has started. `crashed` and `truncated` are the two ways a
complete list is still not the whole tree: a walker that died partway
through it, and a tree bigger than the host's ceiling. Listen for
`"FileIndexReady"` with `maki.api.create_autocmd` to be told when a walk
lands rather than polling for it.

The tools that write, move and delete files mark the tree they touched, so
a call a moment after an edit re-walks and a file the agent just wrote is
findable. A file a `bash` command creates or deletes is not: a shell
command cannot say what it touched, and maki does not try to guess. That
leaves the staleness window as the only guarantee, and it is this: a walk
is redone the first time anything asks for the index more than twenty
seconds after the last one landed, so a path may be missing from the list,
or offered after it is gone, for up to twenty seconds.

A second call from the same plugin cancels the one in flight, which answers
with nil plus an error. While the user types that is expected, so treat the
error as a stale answer. A plugin reading more than four roots keeps the
four it asked for most recently: the walk behind an older one is let go and
asking for it again walks it again.

Requires the `fs_read` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Parameters:**

- `{opts?}` (`table?`) Options:
  - `query` (`string`) what the user typed. Empty returns the first `limit` paths in walk order.
  - `limit` (`integer`) how many items to return, at most 500. Default 20.
  - `path` (`string`) the root to search, the cwd or below it. Default is the current working directory.
  - `highlights` (`boolean`) also return where the query matched each path. Default false.

**Returns:** (`table?`, `string?`) `{ root = string, complete = boolean, crashed = boolean, truncated = boolean, items = { { path = string, highlights = integer[][]? } } }`, or nil plus an error message. `root` is the resolved absolute directory the paths are relative to, spelled the way `"FileIndexReady"` spells it, so an event can be matched to the call that caused it. It is absent for a directory with no UTF-8 spelling, as it is on the event, so a plugin that gets no `root` treats every event as a reason to ask again rather than matching the wrong tree. `items` is a 1-based array, best first. `highlights` is only present when asked for, and holds `{ from, to }` byte ranges of `path`, ascending, 1-based and inclusive, so `path:sub(from, to)` is the matched text.

**Example:**

```lua
local res, err = maki.fs.fuzzy_files({ query = "src/mai", limit = 20, highlights = true })
if err then return end -- a newer call took over, this answer is stale
for _, item in ipairs(res.items) do
  local r = item.highlights[1]
  print(item.path, r and item.path:sub(r[1], r[2]))
end
if not res.complete then print("still scanning, ask again") end
```


## maki.hash {#maki-hash}

Content hashing. Digests are short enough for a model to pass back as
`expected_content_hash` on write and edit tools.

```lua
maki.hash.sha256("hello")
```

---

### `maki.hash.sha256()` {#maki-hash-sha256}

```lua

Accepts both strings and Luau buffers.

**Parameters:**

- `{data}` (`string|buffer`) Data to hash.

**Returns:** (`string`) Hex digest.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.hash.sha256("hello")
```


## maki.image {#maki-image}

Small building blocks for working with images: probe metadata, decode
pixels, resize, and encode back to bytes. Plugins compose these freely.

Decoding is guarded against pixel-bomb attacks (50 MP limit).

```lua
local img = maki.image.decode(raw_bytes)
local small = img:resize(1024, 768)
local png = small:encode("png")
```

---

### `maki.image.probe()` {#maki-image-probe}

```lua
maki.image.probe({data})
```

Read image metadata (format, dimensions) from raw bytes without fully
decoding the pixels. Much faster than `decode` when you only need to
check the size or format.

Returns a table with `format` (string), `width` (integer), `height`
(integer), or `(nil, err)` if the bytes are not a recognized image.

**Parameters:**

- `{data}` (`string|buffer`) Raw image bytes.

**Returns:** (`table?`, `string?`) Info table, or `(nil, err)` on failure.

**Example:**

```lua
local info, err = maki.image.probe(raw_bytes)
if err then error(err) end
print(info.format, info.width, info.height)
```

---

### `maki.image.decode()` {#maki-image-decode}

```lua
maki.image.decode({data})
```

Decode raw image bytes into an Image handle you can resize and re-encode.
Images larger than 50 megapixels are rejected to prevent memory bombs.

**Parameters:**

- `{data}` (`string|buffer`) Raw image bytes.

**Returns:** ([`maki.image.Image?`](#maki-image-Image), `string?`) Decoded image, or `(nil, err)` on failure.

**Example:**

```lua
local img, err = maki.image.decode(raw_bytes)
if err then error(err) end
print(img:width() .. "x" .. img:height())
```


## maki.image.Image {#maki-image-Image}

A decoded image you can inspect, resize, and re-encode.

Get one from `maki.image.decode()`. The image data lives in memory
until the handle is garbage collected.

---

### `Image:width()` {#Image-width}

```lua
Image:width()
```

Get the width of the image in pixels.

**Returns:** (`integer`) Width in pixels.

---

### `Image:height()` {#Image-height}

```lua
Image:height()
```

Get the height of the image in pixels.

**Returns:** (`integer`) Height in pixels.

---

### `Image:resize()` {#Image-resize}

```lua
Image:resize({max_w}, {max_h})
```

Shrink the image to fit inside {max_w} x {max_h}, keeping the aspect
ratio. If the image already fits, it is returned as-is. Never upscales.

**Parameters:**

- `{max_w}` (`integer`) Maximum width in pixels. Must be positive.
- `{max_h}` (`integer`) Maximum height in pixels. Must be positive.

**Returns:** ([`maki.image.Image`](#maki-image-Image)) A new image handle (or the same one if no resize was needed).

**Example:**

```lua
local img = maki.image.decode(raw_bytes)
local small = img:resize(800, 600)
local encoded = small:encode("jpeg")
```

---

### `Image:encode()` {#Image-encode}

```lua
Image:encode({format})
```

Encode the image into raw bytes in the given format. Use this to prepare
images for sending over the network or writing to disk.

**Parameters:**

- `{format}` (`string`) Output format: `"png"`, `"jpeg"`, or `"jpg"`.

**Returns:** (`string`) Encoded image bytes.

**Example:**

```lua
local bytes = img:encode("png")
-- bytes is a Lua string containing the raw PNG data
```


## maki.interpreter {#maki-interpreter}

Run Python code in a memory-safe, time-limited sandbox.

The sandbox uses the monty interpreter. Python code can call back into
Lua-defined tools, and stdout is streamed line by line.

```lua
local r, err = maki.interpreter.run("print('hello')", {
  timeout = 10,
  max_memory_mb = 128,
  on_output = function(line) print(line) end,
})
```

---

### `maki.interpreter.run()` {#maki-interpreter-run}

```lua
maki.interpreter.run({code}, {opts})
```

Run Python code in a sandboxed interpreter with memory and time limits.
Stdout lines are streamed to your {on_output} callback as they are produced.
If the Python code calls tools, those calls are dispatched to the Lua
functions you provide in {opts}.tools.

The result table has optional fields: `stdout` (string, trimmed combined
output) and `output` (string, the final expression value). On error, the
table is empty and the second return value is the error message.

Requires the `run` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Parameters:**

- `{code}` (`string`) Python source code to execute.
- `{opts}` (`table`) Required fields:
  - `timeout` (`integer`) execution time limit in seconds.
  - `max_memory_mb` (`integer`) memory limit in megabytes.
  - `on_output` (`function`) called with each stdout line (string) as it is
    produced. Must not yield.

  Optional fields:

  - `preamble` (`string?`) Python source (imports, helpers) compiled ahead of
    {code}. Tracebacks are rebased so line 1 is {code} line 1.
  - `tools` (`table?`) map of `name -> function` for tools the sandbox may call.
    Each function receives the tool input table and must return `(string)` or
    `(nil, err)`. Tool calls are batched and dispatched concurrently.
  - `files` (`table?`) serves text file access from `open()` and `pathlib`.
    `read(path)` returns `(content)`, `write(path, content, append)` returns
    `(string)`, and both return `(nil, err)` on failure. Leave one out to
    refuse that access. Writes wait and go out as one `write` per file right
    before a tool call, a read of that path, or the end of the run, and a
    cancelled run drops the ones still waiting. A failed write ends the run,
    unless a read sent it, then it raises `OSError` just like a failed read.

**Returns:** (`table`, `string?`) Result table, plus an error string on failure.

**Example:**

```lua
local result, err = maki.interpreter.run("print(2 + 2)", {
  timeout = 30,
  max_memory_mb = 256,
  on_output = function(line) print("py: " .. line) end,
})
if err then error(err) end
if result.stdout then print(result.stdout) end
```


## maki.json {#maki-json}

JSON encoding, decoding, and schema validation. Encode Lua
tables to JSON strings, decode JSON back into tables, and
optionally validate data against a JSON Schema.

```lua
local s = maki.json.encode({ ok = true })
local t = maki.json.decode(s)
```

---

### `maki.json.encode()` {#maki-json-encode}

```lua
maki.json.encode({value})
```

Turn a Lua value into a JSON string. Tables, strings, numbers,
booleans, and nil all work. Functions and userdata cannot be
serialized.

**Parameters:**

- `{value}` (`any`) Lua value to encode.

**Returns:** (`string?`, `string?`) JSON string, or nil plus an error.

**Example:**

```lua
local s, err = maki.json.encode({ name = "maki", version = 1 })
print(s) -- {"name":"maki","version":1}
```

---

### `maki.json.decode()` {#maki-json-decode}

```lua
maki.json.decode({str})
```

Parse a JSON string into a Lua value. Objects become tables and
arrays become 1-indexed sequences.

**Parameters:**

- `{str}` (`string`) JSON string to decode.

**Returns:** (`any?`, `string?`) Decoded value, or nil plus an error.

**Example:**

```lua
local t, err = maki.json.decode('{"x": 42}')
print(t.x) -- 42
```

---

### `maki.json.schema_validator()` {#maki-json-schema_validator}

```lua
maki.json.schema_validator({schema})
```

Compile a JSON Schema into a reusable validator object. Supports
draft-07, 2019-09, and 2020-12. Schema errors show up right away so
you catch mistakes before doing any real work.

**Parameters:**

- `{schema}` (`table`) JSON Schema as a Lua table.

**Returns:** ([`maki.json.SchemaValidator?`](#maki-json-SchemaValidator), `string?`) Validator, or nil plus an error.

**Example:**

```lua
local v, err = maki.json.schema_validator({
  type = "object",
  properties = { name = { type = "string" } },
  required = { "name" },
})
local errs = v:validate({ name = "maki" })
assert(errs == nil)
```


## maki.json.SchemaValidator {#maki-json-SchemaValidator}

A compiled JSON Schema validator. Create one with `maki.json.schema_validator()` and reuse it to validate many values without recompiling the schema each time.

---

### `SchemaValidator:validate()` {#SchemaValidator-validate}

```lua
SchemaValidator:validate({value})
```

Check {value} against the compiled schema. Returns nil when the value is valid. When validation fails, returns a list of human-readable error strings.

**Parameters:**

- `{value}` (`any`) The Lua value to validate.

**Returns:** (`table?`) Array of error strings, or nil if valid.

**Example:**

```lua
local errs = validator:validate({ name = 123 })
if errs then
for _, msg in ipairs(errs) do print(msg) end
end
```


## maki.keymap {#maki-keymap}

Key mappings, modeled after `vim.keymap`.

```lua
maki.keymap.set("n", "<C-t>", function()
  print("hello")
end, { desc = "Say hello" })
```

## Key notation

`set`, `del`, the `keys` option of `maki.ui.open_win` and `win:recv`
key events all use one notation. `normalize` converts any accepted
spelling to the canonical one.

```lua
if ev.type == "key" and ev.key == "<CR>" then submit() end
```

A single character stands for itself: `a`, `A`, `7`, `?`. Other keys
go in angle brackets, after any modifiers.

| Key | Notation | Also accepted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enter | `<CR>` | `<Enter>`, `<Return>` |
| Escape | `<Esc>` | `<Escape>` |
| Backspace | `<BS>` | `<Backspace>` |
| Delete | `<Del>` | `<Delete>` |
| Tab | `<Tab>` | |
| Shift+Tab | `<S-Tab>` | |
| Space | `<Space>` | |
| Arrows | `<Up>`, `<Down>`, `<Left>`, `<Right>` | |
| Navigation | `<Home>`, `<End>`, `<PageUp>`, `<PageDown>`, `<Insert>` | |
| Function keys | `<F1>` through `<F24>` | |

Modifiers are `C-` (control), `M-` (alt) and `S-` (shift), in that
order: `<C-M-x>`. `Ctrl-`, `Alt-`, `A-` and `Shift-` are accepted as
input.

Terminals report some keys differently, so maki picks one form:

- Control plus a letter is lowercase: `<C-N>` is `<C-n>`, as in Vim.
- Shift plus a letter is the uppercase letter: `<S-a>` is `A`.
- Without control or alt, shift is part of the char typed, so the key
  is that char: Shift+1 on a US layout is `!`, and `<S-!>` is `!`.
  `<S-Space>` is `<Space>`. With alt the prefix stays: `<M-S-1>`.
- Shift+Tab is always `<S-Tab>`, with or without the kitty keyboard
  protocol.

Key strings in a plugin and every module it `require`s are checked at
load. Each invalid one is logged with its file and line, and the status
bar shows a summary, so a typo shows up at startup.

Upgrading from older versions: `win:recv` used to deliver `"enter"`,
`"esc"`, `"ctrl+n"` and `"shift+tab"`. These now arrive as `<CR>`,
`<Esc>`, `<C-n>` and `<S-Tab>`, and the load check flags the old
spellings.

### `maki.keymap.set()` {#maki-keymap-set}

```lua
maki.keymap.set({mode}, {lhs}, {rhs}, {opts?})
```

Bind a key to a Lua function, like `vim.keymap.set`. Only normal mode
(`"n"`) is supported.

Bindings are global and belong to the plugin that set them. They stack:
the last `set` wins, and when that plugin calls `del` or unloads, the
previous holder gets the key back. Shadowing another plugin's binding logs
a warning naming both. Setting a key you already hold replaces your
binding.

For a key a popup should own only while it is on screen, use the `keys`
option of `maki.ui.open_win` instead.

A handler that runs consumes the key, even if it raises (the error is
logged). If the plugin has too many callbacks in flight, the key goes to
maki's built-in binding rather than to the binding underneath.

`<C-c>` and `<C-z>` are reserved so quit and suspend always work. Binding
either is an error.

**Parameters:**

- `{mode}` (`string`) Mode letter. Currently only `"n"` is accepted.
- `{lhs}` (`string`) Key in Vim notation, e.g. `"<C-t>"`, `"<Space>"`, `"a"`.
- `{rhs}` (`function`) Called when the key is pressed. The return value is ignored.
- `{opts?}` (`table?`) Options:
  - `desc` (`string`) short description shown in the keymap list.
  - `unique` (`boolean`) fail the call, naming the owner, when anything
    already maps the key. Default false.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.keymap.set("n", "<C-t>", function()
  print("toggle!")
end, { desc = "Toggle panel" })
```

---

### `maki.keymap.del()` {#maki-keymap-del}

```lua
maki.keymap.del({mode}, {lhs})
```

Remove your plugin's mapping for {lhs} in {mode}, like `vim.keymap.del`.
The key goes back to whoever held it before you, or to maki's default
binding.

A plugin can only remove its own mappings. If another plugin maps {lhs},
nothing changes and a warning names that plugin. Does nothing if nothing
maps {lhs}.

**Parameters:**

- `{mode}` (`string`) Mode letter (reserved for future modes).
- `{lhs}` (`string`) Key to unmap, in Vim notation.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.keymap.del("n", "<C-t>")
```

---

### `maki.keymap.normalize()` {#maki-keymap-normalize}

```lua
maki.keymap.normalize({lhs})
```

Canonical spelling of {lhs}. Accepts every spelling `set` accepts and
returns the string a `key` event carries.

**Parameters:**

- `{lhs}` (`string`) Key in any accepted notation.

**Returns:** (`string|nil`, `string|nil`) Canonical notation, or nil and an error.

**Example:**

```lua
local canon = maki.keymap.normalize("<Enter>")  -- "<CR>"
```


## maki.log {#maki-log}

Structured logging for plugins.

Each call emits a tracing event tagged with the calling plugin's name.
Messages show up in maki's log output, which you can view with `maki --log`.

```lua
maki.log.info("ready")
maki.log.warn("something looks off")
```

---

### `maki.log.debug()` {#maki-log-debug}

```lua
maki.log.debug({msg})
```

Emit a DEBUG-level log message. Useful for development and troubleshooting.
The message is tagged with the plugin name automatically.

**Parameters:**

- `{msg}` (`string`) Message to log.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.log.debug("loaded " .. #items .. " items")
```

---

### `maki.log.info()` {#maki-log-info}

```lua
maki.log.info({msg})
```

Emit an INFO-level log message. Good for normal operational events.

**Parameters:**

- `{msg}` (`string`) Message to log.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.log.info("plugin initialized")
```

---

### `maki.log.warn()` {#maki-log-warn}

```lua
maki.log.warn({msg})
```

Emit a WARN-level log message. Use for recoverable problems.

**Parameters:**

- `{msg}` (`string`) Message to log.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.log.warn("config file missing, using defaults")
```

---

### `maki.log.error()` {#maki-log-error}

```lua
maki.log.error({msg})
```

Emit an ERROR-level log message. Use for failures that need attention.

**Parameters:**

- `{msg}` (`string`) Message to log.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.log.error("failed to connect to API")
```


## maki.model {#maki-model}

The model behind the focused session. Good for a keybind that flips
between your two go-to models, or lifts thinking for one hard question.
Without an interactive UI every function returns
`nil, "no interactive UI attached"`.

---

### `maki.model.get()` {#maki-model-get}

```lua
maki.model.get()
```

Reads the focused session's model, thinking level, and fast mode.
`thinking` comes back in the spelling `set` accepts, so a table from here
can go straight back in.

`thinking_options` is every thinking value this model accepts, cheapest
first: `{name, tokens?}` per row, where `tokens` is the budget maki would
send for that row and is absent on `off` and `adaptive`. It is empty exactly
when `supports_thinking` is false, so a picker can render the ladder from it
without knowing the levels.

**Returns:** (`table|nil`, `string|nil`) `{spec, id, provider, thinking,
  thinking_options, fast, supports_thinking, supports_fast}`, or nil and an
  error.

**Example:**

```lua
local m = maki.model.get()
if m.spec ~= "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6" then ... end
for _, option in ipairs(m.thinking_options) do
  print(option.name, option.tokens)
end
```

---

### `maki.model.available()` {#maki-model-available}

```lua
maki.model.available()
```

Lists the model specs you can switch to: what the providers you are logged
into offer, minus what your model policy blocks. The list fills in the
background at startup, so right after launch it can still be empty.

**Returns:** (`table|nil`, `string|nil`) Array of `"provider/id"` specs, or nil and an error.

**Example:**

```lua
local specs = maki.model.available()
```

---

### `maki.model.set()` {#maki-model-set}

```lua
maki.model.set({opts})
```

Switches the focused session's model, thinking level, or fast mode. Fields
you leave out stay as they are, so this doubles as a thinking-only switch.
Answers with the new state, in the same shape `get` returns.

**Parameters:**

- `{opts}` (`string|table`) A model spec, or a table with any of:
  - `spec` (`string`) `"provider/id"`, as listed by `available()`;
  - `thinking` (`string|number`) `"off"`, `"adaptive"`, an effort level

  (`"minimal"` to `"max"`), a token budget, or `""` to toggle it on and off;

  - `fast` (`boolean`) Anthropic fast mode.

**Returns:** (`table|nil`, `string|nil`) The new state, or nil and an error.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.model.set("anthropic/claude-opus-4-6")
maki.model.set({ spec = "zai/glm-5", thinking = "high" })
maki.keymap.set("n", "<M-t>", function() maki.model.set({ thinking = "" }) end)
```

---

### `maki.model.tier()` {#maki-model-tier}

```lua
maki.model.tier({name}, {provider?})
```

The model maki uses for a tier, the same one a subagent asking for that
tier gets: your pick from the `/model` picker, else the curated default.
`assigned` tells the two apart. Pass `provider` to prefer its models, the
way subagents prefer the session's provider.

**Parameters:**

- `{name}` (`string`) `"weak"`, `"medium"`, `"strong"`, or `"compaction"`.
- `{provider?}` (`string|nil`) Provider slug to resolve within first.

**Returns:** (`table|nil`, `string|nil`) The model in the shape `info` returns, plus
  `assigned` (boolean), true when you picked it for this tier. nil and nil
  when no model fits the tier, nil and an error when the spec no longer
  resolves.

**Example:**

```lua
local m = maki.model.tier("weak", maki.model.get().provider)
if m then maki.model.set(m.spec) end
```

---

### `maki.model.info()` {#maki-model-info}

```lua
maki.model.info({spec})
```

Resolve a model spec to everything maki knows about it: identity, tier,
context window, and the price table the session would be billed by --
including rates resolved from provider config or the bundled catalog
(e.g. subsidised custom providers), which the provider's own /v1/models
endpoint may never report. Purely local -- no UI round-trip, no network
-- so it also works from slash commands and headless embeddings.

**Parameters:**

- `{spec}` (`string`) `"provider/id"`, as listed by `available()`.

**Returns:** (`table|nil`, `string|nil`) `{spec, id, provider, provider_display,
  tier, subsidised_by?, context_window, max_output_tokens?, free?,
  pricing?}`, or nil and an error.

  `free` has three states: `true` when the model is known to cost nothing,
  `false` when it is metered, and nil when no source ever quoted a rate.
  Check `~= nil` before trusting it.

  `subsidised_by` names the subscription prepaying this provider (billed
  cost is $0, the rates are the list-price reference). It sits at the top
  level because it holds whether or not rates resolved.

  `pricing` is present only when rates are known:
  `{input, output, cache_write, cache_read}` in USD per million tokens,
  plus optional `fast = {input, output}`.

**Example:**

```lua
local m, err = maki.model.info("anthropic/claude-opus-4-6")
if m and m.subsidised_by then print(m.subsidised_by, m.pricing.input) end
```


## maki.net {#maki-net}

HTTP and plain TCP for plugins.

`request` traffic goes over HTTPS (plain HTTP is upgraded). Private
and metadata IP addresses are blocked to prevent SSRF, including
after a redirect. Hosts listed in the `net.allowed_private_hosts` config
option are exempt, and so is a provider plugin's own origin (see
`maki.net.request`). Failed requests (5xx) are retried automatically.

Requests reuse a pool of clients, so calls to the same host share one
keep-alive connection rather than pay a fresh handshake each time.

`connect` follows the same rules, but only reaches hosts the plugin
lists in `net_hosts`.

```lua
local res, err = maki.net.request("https://example.com")
if res then print(res.body) end
```

---

### `maki.net.request()` {#maki-net-request}

```lua
maki.net.request({url}, {opts?})
```

Make an HTTP request and return the response body. Plain `http://`
URLs are automatically upgraded to `https://`. Requests to private
or metadata IP addresses are blocked for safety, unless the host is
listed in `net.allowed_private_hosts`.

A request to the origin of a provider this plugin registered is sent
like the provider's chat requests: no address check, no https upgrade,
maki's user agent, and connect and stall timeouts instead of a total
one. This holds only for an origin the user set (`<SLUG>_BASE_URL`,
`providers.toml`) or a built-in provider's default.

{opts} fields:
  `method` (string) HTTP verb (default `"GET"`).
  `headers` (table) Header name/value pairs.
  `body` (string) Request body.
  `timeout` (integer) Total timeout in seconds, max 120 (default 30,
    none on a provider's origin).
  `max_bytes` (integer) Max response size in bytes (default 5 MB).
  `retry` (integer) Retries on 5xx errors (default 3).
  `line_match` (string) Regex. Keep only the response lines it
  matches. Filtering happens after the body is read, so `max_bytes`
  still caps the transfer.

The response table has `body` (string), `status` (integer),
`content_type` (string) and `headers` (table). `headers` holds the final
response's headers under lowercase names, as in
`res.headers["retry-after"]`. Repeated headers are joined with `, `,
which breaks `set-cookie`. A failed response can go straight to
`maki.provider.http_error`.

Requires the `net` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Parameters:**

- `{url}` (`string`) URL starting with `http://` or `https://`.
- `{opts?}` (`table?`) Request options (see above).

**Returns:** (`table?`, `string?`) Response table, or nil plus an error string.

**Example:**

```lua
local res, err = maki.net.request("https://httpbin.org/get")
if err then
  print("failed: " .. err)
else
  print(res.status, res.body)
end
```

---

### `maki.net.connect()` {#maki-net-connect}

```lua
maki.net.connect({host}, {port}, {opts?})
```

Open a plain TCP connection to {host}:{port}, such as a dashboard or a
language server running on your machine. There is no TLS.

The plugin must list the host in `net_hosts`, best with its port
(`"127.0.0.1:7777"`): unlike `request`, `net = true` alone reaches
nothing. Private and loopback addresses are blocked like in `request`,
unless `net.allowed_private_hosts` allows them.

`read` and `write` yield, so a connection that stays open belongs in a
`maki.async.spawn` task. It closes on `conn:close()`, when the handle is
garbage collected, and when the plugin unloads.

{opts} fields:
  `timeout` (integer) Connect timeout in seconds, max 60 (default 10).

Requires the `net` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Parameters:**

- `{host}` (`string`) Host name or IP address.
- `{port}` (`integer`) Port to connect to.
- `{opts?}` (`table?`) Options (see above).

**Returns:** ([`maki.net.Conn?`](#maki-net-Conn), `string?`) The connection, or nil plus an error string.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.async.spawn(function()
  local conn, err = maki.net.connect("127.0.0.1", 7777)
  if not conn then return maki.log.error(err) end
  conn:write("hello\n")
  while true do
    local chunk = conn:read()
    if not chunk then break end
    handle(chunk)
  end
  conn:close()
end)
```


## maki.net.Conn {#maki-net-Conn}

A TCP connection opened by `maki.net.connect`.

`read` and `write` yield until done and can run at the same time.
The connection closes on `:close()`, when the handle is garbage
collected, and when the plugin unloads.

---

### `Conn:read()` {#Conn-read}

```lua
Conn:read()
```

Wait for data and return what arrived, at most 64 KiB. Returns
`nil, nil` once the peer has closed its side.

Only one read at a time: a second `read()` while one is waiting returns
an error. A read and a write can run at the same time.

**Returns:** (`string?`, `string?`) Bytes read, or nil plus an error string, or nil, nil at end of stream.

**Example:**

```lua
local chunk, err = conn:read()
if err then return maki.log.error(err) end
if not chunk then print("peer closed") end
```

---

### `Conn:write()` {#Conn-write}

```lua
Conn:write({data})
```

Send {data} and wait until all of it is written. Writes made while one
is in flight wait their turn, so each goes out whole and in call order.
A write that is cancelled or fails partway closes the connection,
because the peer would read the next write as the rest of the cut one.

**Parameters:**

- `{data}` (`string`) Bytes to send.

**Returns:** (`boolean?`, `string?`) `true`, or nil plus an error string.

**Example:**

```lua
local ok, err = conn:write(maki.json.encode(msg) .. "\n")
if not ok then return maki.log.error(err) end
```

---

### `Conn:close()` {#Conn-close}

```lua
Conn:close()
```

Close the connection. A read or write in flight ends with an error.
Extra calls do nothing.


## maki.provider {#maki-provider}

Providers implemented in Lua.

A registered provider works like a built-in one: its models show up in
the picker, and its requests get the usual retries, pricing and usage
accounting. The [Providers guide](/docs/providers/#plugin-providers)
covers writing one.

```lua
maki.provider.register({
  slug = "acme",
  display_name = "Acme",
  codec = "openai",
  base_url = "https://api.acme.com/v1",
  api_key_env = "ACME_API_KEY",
  models = { { prefixes = { "acme-large" }, tier = "strong" } },
})
```

---

### `maki.provider.register()` {#maki-provider-register}

```lua
maki.provider.register({spec})
```

Register a provider this plugin implements. Its models are addressed as
`<slug>/<model>` and appear in the model picker and in `/model`.

Call it at the top level of the plugin file, since registration only works
while the plugin loads. The plugin needs a non-empty `net_hosts` list in its
`plugin.toml`. The [Providers guide](/docs/providers/#plugin-providers)
walks through a full example.

Set exactly one of `codec` or `base`. An unknown key, or an option the
chosen codec cannot honour, fails registration.

Every hook is optional and gets a `ctx` table as its first argument:
  `ctx.slug` (string) The slug the hook serves.
  `ctx.base_url` (string?) The origin requests go to right now: an origin
          `auth` returned, then `<SLUG>_BASE_URL` or `providers.toml`,
          then the declared `base_url`, nil when none is set. Build URLs
          from it so side calls follow a user who points the slug at a
          gateway.
  `ctx.headers` (table) The headers every request to the slug carries.
  `ctx.get_json(target)` (function) A GET with `ctx.headers`. A `target`
          starting with `/` is appended to `ctx.base_url`, an absolute URL
          is used as is. Never retried. Returns the decoded body, or nil
          plus an error the hook can return as its own.

A hook fails by returning `nil, err`, with `err` from `ctx.get_json` or
`maki.provider.http_error`. Maki then retries and honours `retry-after` as
it does for a built-in provider.

{spec} fields:
  `slug` (string) Required. Letters, digits, `_` and `-`, starting with a
          letter or digit. Must not be a slug Maki ships, one it serves
          from models.dev, or one defined in `providers.toml`.
  `display_name` (string) Required. Shown in the UI.
  `codec` (string) Wire format: `"openai"`, `"openai-responses"`,
          `"anthropic"` or `"google"`.
  `base` (string) A native provider to borrow whole, e.g. `"ollama"`.
          Prefer `codec` for a new provider.
  `base_url` (string) Default origin. Must be `https`, or `http` on
          loopback, and its host must match `net_hosts`. Only with
          `codec`. A `base` moves only to an origin the `auth` hook
          returns, so plans with a `base_url` need a `codec` too.
  `api_key_env` (string) Env var holding the API key, re-read each time
          the provider is built. Sent as `x-api-key` for anthropic,
          `x-goog-api-key` for google, and a bearer token otherwise.
          Also lists the provider in `maki auth login`, which saves the
          key. Needs the `env` permission.
  `default_model` (string) Model id without the slug, selected after
          `maki auth login`.
  `login_url` (string) Page `maki auth login` opens to get a key.
  `plans` (table) List of `{ key, display_name, base_url, default_model,
          login_url }` for `maki auth login` to offer. `key` and
          `display_name` are required. A plan's `base_url` defaults to
          the provider's and must match `net_hosts`. The choice is saved
          as `plan` in `providers.toml`.
  `family` (string) `"generic"`, `"claude"`, `"gpt"`, `"gemini"`,
          `"glm"` or `"synthetic"`. Applies to models without a row.
          Defaults to the provider behind `codec` or `base`.
  `accepts_arbitrary_models` (boolean) Assign tiers to `list_models`
          results. When false, tiers come only from `models`. This and
          the next two default to the `base` provider's, or with a
          `codec` to `true`, `16384` and `128000`.
  `max_output_tokens` (integer|false) Output cap for rows that leave it
          out and models without a row. `false` sends no cap.
  `context_window` (integer) Context window for rows that leave it out
          and models without a row.
  `pricing_schedule` (table) Peak-hour pricing, as
          `{ windows = { { 1, 4 }, ... }, multiplier = 2,
          weekdays_only = true }`. Windows are `{ start, end }` UTC
          hours with `end` exclusive. Row `pricing` is the off-peak rate.
  `aperture` (table) `{ path_prefix = "/v1" }` routes Aperture models
          of this slug through this provider.
  `docs` (table) `{ features, discovery_note }` for the generated
          [Providers](/docs/providers/) page. `discovery_note` replaces
          the model table when `models` is empty.
  `system_prefix` (string) Text prepended to the system prompt. The
          `google` codec refuses it.
  `openai` (table) Options for `codec = "openai"`, all optional:
    `max_tokens_field` (string) Body field carrying the output cap.
            Defaults to `max_tokens`.
    `include_stream_usage` (boolean) Ask for usage on the stream.
            Defaults to `true`.
    `thinking` (table) How the API spells reasoning effort. Without it,
            each model's `thinking_fields` decides.
      `dialect` (string) Required. One of `"standard"`, `"codex"`,
              `"codex-5-1"`, `"coding-plan"`, `"gpt-5-6"`, `"gpt-6"`,
              `"prefer-high"`, `"high-only"`, `"glm"`, `"deepseek"`,
              `"anthropic-adaptive"`, `"tensorx"`, `"grok"` or
              `"ollama"`.
      `field` (string) Body path for the effort. Dots nest, e.g.
              `"reasoning.effort"`. Defaults to `reasoning_effort`.
      `requires_support` (boolean) Send effort only to models that
              support thinking. Defaults to `false`.
    `headers` (table) Sent with every request. A header the credentials
            set wins. `host`, `content-length`, `transfer-encoding` and
            `connection` are refused.
    `extra_body` (table) Merged into every request body.
    `session_id` (table) Sends the session id, as
            `{ header = "x-affinity" }` or `{ body_field = "session_id" }`.
    `thinking_overrides` (table) Model id prefix to `"no"`, `"yes"` or
            `"required"`, overriding the model table. Longest prefix wins.
  `models` (table) Static model rows, read once at registration. They
           describe models and add to the runtime list. See
           [model rows](/docs/providers/#model-rows).
  `auth` (function) `function(ctx, purpose)` returning
           `{ base_url = ..., headers = { ... } }`. `purpose` is
           `"resolve"` before the first request, `"refresh"` after a 401,
           or `"reload"` after a login changed the stored credentials.
           Omitting `base_url` keeps the current one.
  `list_models` (function) `function(ctx)` returning model rows for a
           catalogue only known at runtime. Without it, the provider
           lists what its codec or base lists. Rows carry `id`,
           `context_window`, `max_output_tokens`, `pricing`,
           `supports_thinking`, `supports_vision` and `tier`, plus two
           optional fields. `extra` is any JSON value, handed back to
           `build_body` as `opts.model_info`. `effort` narrows the
           `openai.thinking` dialect for this model: `supported` lists the
           effort names the provider accepts, and `send_off` is `true` to
           send `"none"` for off or `false` to send nothing.
  `build_body` (function) `function(ctx, body, model, opts)` returning
           the body to send. `opts.thinking` is the rendered effort level,
           nil when thinking is off. `openai` codecs only.
  `map_error` (function) `function(ctx, status, message)` returning
           `{ status = ..., message = ... }`, or nil to keep the error.
           Retryability follows the returned status.
  `fetch_usage` (function) `function(ctx)` returning
           `{ plan = ..., limits = { { label = ..., percentage = ...,
           reset_at = ..., detail = ... } }, by_model_today = { { model = ...,
           input_tokens = ..., output_tokens = ..., total_tokens = ...,
           spend_microdollars = ... } } }` or nil. Only `label` is
           required in a limit, and `by_model_today` is optional.
  `login` (function) `function(ctx)`. Defining it lists the provider in
           `maki auth login`. This `ctx` also has `ctx.print(text)`,
           `ctx.prompt({ label = ..., secret = ... })` and
           `ctx.open_url(url)`.
  `logout` (function) `function(ctx)`, run by `maki auth logout` before
           Maki deletes the stored credentials itself. Only needed for
           work Maki cannot do, such as revoking a token upstream.

Requires the `net` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Parameters:**

- `{spec}` (`table`) Provider specification (see above).

**Example:**

```lua
maki.provider.register({
  slug = "acme",
  display_name = "Acme",
  codec = "openai",
  base_url = "https://api.acme.com/v1",
  models = {
    { prefixes = { "acme-large" }, tier = "strong", context_window = 200000 },
  },
  auth = function(ctx)
    local creds = maki.provider.auth.get(ctx.slug) or {}
    return { headers = { Authorization = "Bearer " .. (creds.token or "") } }
  end,
})
```

---

### `maki.provider.http_error()` {#maki-provider-http_error}

```lua
maki.provider.http_error({res})
```

Turn a failed `maki.net.request` response into a provider error. A hook
returns it as `return nil, err`, and Maki handles it like a built-in
provider's failure: a 429 or 5xx is retried and `retry-after` sets the
wait. A hook that raises instead fails as a broken hook.

{res} fields:
  `status` (integer) Required. The HTTP status.
  `body` (string) Required. Becomes the error message.
  `headers` (table) Only `retry-after` is read, case-insensitively.

**Parameters:**

- `{res}` (`table`) A response from `maki.net.request`.

**Returns:** (`userdata`) A `ProviderError`. Opaque, but `tostring` renders it.

**Example:**

```lua
fetch_usage = function(ctx)
  local res = assert(maki.net.request(ctx.base_url .. "/usage", { headers = ctx.headers }))
  if res.status ~= 200 then
    return nil, maki.provider.http_error(res)
  end
  return { limits = {} }
end
```


## maki.provider.auth {#maki-provider-auth}

Credential storage for the providers this plugin registered.

Each slug gets one JSON file at
`~/.local/state/maki/auth/plugins/<slug>.json`, with mode 0600, atomic
writes and a lock against other Maki processes. The plugin decides what
goes in it. A plugin can only reach slugs it registered itself.

```lua
maki.provider.auth.set("acme", { access_token = tok, expires = when })
local creds = maki.provider.auth.get("acme")
maki.provider.auth.clear("acme")
```

---

### `maki.provider.auth.get()` {#maki-provider-auth-get}

```lua
maki.provider.auth.get({slug})
```

Read the credentials this plugin stored for one of its providers. Returns
nil when nothing was stored yet, for example before the first login.

**Parameters:**

- `{slug}` (`string`) A provider slug this plugin registered.

**Returns:** (`table?`, `string?`) The stored credentials, or nil plus an error.

**Example:**

```lua
local creds = maki.provider.auth.get("acme")
if creds then print(creds.access_token) end
```

---

### `maki.provider.auth.set()` {#maki-provider-auth-set}

```lua
maki.provider.auth.set({slug}, {credentials})
```

Store credentials for one of this plugin's providers, replacing what was
there. Any table with string keys works, such as a token plus its expiry.
An `auth` hook can call it to save a refreshed token.

**Parameters:**

- `{slug}` (`string`) A provider slug this plugin registered.
- `{credentials}` (`table`) Any table with string keys.

**Returns:** (`boolean?`, `string?`) True, or nil plus an error string.

**Example:**

```lua
local ok, err = maki.provider.auth.set("acme", { access_token = token })
if not ok then maki.log.error(err) end
```

---

### `maki.provider.auth.clear()` {#maki-provider-auth-clear}

```lua
maki.provider.auth.clear({slug})
```

Forget the credentials stored for one of this plugin's providers.

**Parameters:**

- `{slug}` (`string`) A provider slug this plugin registered.

**Returns:** (`boolean?`, `string?`) True, or nil plus an error string.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.provider.auth.clear("acme")
```


## maki.session {#maki-session}

Host session primitives. The interactive UI can run several sessions
at once. These functions list, create, focus, rename, and delete them.

Without a UI, most functions return `nil, "no interactive UI attached"`.
`current` and `read` still work under `maki -p` and the sdk.
`messages` and `notify` work everywhere, ACP included.

---

### `maki.session.list()` {#maki-session-list}

```lua
maki.session.list()
```

Lists sessions stored for the current project. Answered from a
background scan, so a slow disk never blocks the UI.

**Returns:** (`table|nil`, `string|nil`) Array of `{id, title, updated_at}`, or nil and an error.

**Example:**

```lua
local stored, err = maki.session.list()
```

---

### `maki.session.live()` {#maki-session-live}

```lua
maki.session.live()
```

Lists the sessions currently running in this UI. Status is "working",
"needs_input", or "idle". A mailbox follow-up stays "working" without an
intermediate "idle" status.

**Returns:** (`table|nil`, `string|nil`) Array of `{id, title, status, updated_at, focused}`, or nil and an error.

**Example:**

```lua
local live, err = maki.session.live()
```

---

### `maki.session.current()` {#maki-session-current}

```lua
maki.session.current()
```

Returns the id of the focused session. Under `maki -p` and the sdk,
that is the one session they run.

**Returns:** (`string|nil`, `string|nil`) Session id, or nil and an error.

**Example:**

```lua
local id = maki.session.current()
```

---

### `maki.session.read()` {#maki-session-read}

```lua
maki.session.read({opts?})
```

One-call snapshot of a session: queue, usage, context, cost, mode, and
status. Reads the focused session, or the one you name in `session` when
you act on a background tab.

The returned table:
```text
{
  id, cwd, model, mode = "build" | "plan",
  status = "idle" | "working" | "needs_input",
  focused, updated_at,
  usage = { input_tokens, output_tokens, cache_creation_input_tokens, cache_read_input_tokens },
  context_size, context_window,
  cost,
  queue = { count }, -- nil under headless drivers
  title,             -- nil under headless drivers
}
```

`usage` and `cost` include subagent spend. `context_size` is the main
session's own, since a subagent runs its own window. There is no
`list_cost` here: the un-subsidised total for a run arrives on the
`TurnEnd` autocmd, and `maki.model.info` carries the rates behind it.

**Parameters:**

- `{opts?}` (`table?`) `session` (string?) Session id; defaults to focused.

**Returns:** (`table|nil`, `string|nil`) Snapshot table, or nil and an error.

**Example:**

```lua
local s = maki.session.read()
if s.context_size > s.context_window * 0.8 then
  maki.ui.notify("context is nearly full")
end
```

---

### `maki.session.messages()` {#maki-session-messages}

```lua
maki.session.messages({opts?})
```

Reads a live session's transcript, oldest first: everything the model has
been sent so far, tool calls and results included. Read only.

Each message is `{ role, kind, hidden, content }`. `role` is `"user"` or
`"assistant"`. `kind` is `"turn"` for something the user or the model said,
`"observation"` for a report sent to the model as a user message, like
`maki.session.notify`, and `"context_update"` for a change since the
system prompt was built (date, model, plan mode, ...). `hidden` marks a
message only the model sees, such as a nudge or a compaction note.
`content` lists blocks:

```text
{ type = "text", text }
{ type = "thinking", text }
{ type = "tool_use", id, name, input }
{ type = "tool_result", tool_use_id, content, is_error }
{ type = "image", media_type }
```

Works in the TUI, `maki -p`, sdk mode, and ACP. ACP has no focused
session, so pass `session` there. Hook and event payloads carry the
`session_id` to pass.

**Parameters:**

- `{opts?}` (`table?`) Options:
  - `session` (`string?`) id of a live session, defaults to the focused one.
  - `last` (`integer?`) only the newest `last` messages.

**Returns:** (`table|nil`, `string|nil`) Array of messages, or nil and an error.

**Example:**

```lua
local msgs = maki.session.messages({ last = 1 })
local last = msgs and msgs[1]
if last and last.role == "assistant" then
  print(last.content[1].text)
end
```

---

### `maki.session.focus()` {#maki-session-focus}

```lua
maki.session.focus({id})
```

Switches the UI to the session with {id}.

**Parameters:**

- `{id}` (`string`) Session id, as returned by `list()` or `live()`.

**Returns:** (`boolean|nil`, `string|nil`) true on success, or nil and an error.

**Example:**

```lua
local _, err = maki.session.focus(id)
```

---

### `maki.session.delete()` {#maki-session-delete}

```lua
maki.session.delete({id})
```

Deletes a session and its stored history, cancelling it first if it
is running. The focused session cannot be deleted.

**Parameters:**

- `{id}` (`string`) Session id to delete.

**Returns:** (`boolean|nil`, `string|nil`) true on success, or nil and an error.

**Example:**

```lua
local _, err = maki.session.delete(id)
```

---

### `maki.session.new()` {#maki-session-new}

```lua
maki.session.new({opts?})
```

Starts a new session in the current project.

**Parameters:**

- `{opts?}` (`table?`) Optional fields: prompt (string) first user message

  to submit right away; focus (boolean) switch the UI to the new session.


**Returns:** (`string|nil`, `string|nil`) New session id, or nil and an error.

**Example:**

```lua
local id, err = maki.session.new({ prompt = "fix the tests", focus = true })
```

---

### `maki.session.prompt()` {#maki-session-prompt}

```lua
maki.session.prompt({text}, {opts?})
```

Sends {text} as a regular user prompt to a live session. The text is
never interpreted: slash commands, `exit`, and `!` shell prefixes are
all sent to the model verbatim. If the session is currently streaming,
the prompt is queued and picked up when the agent reaches it.

**Parameters:**

- `{text}` (`string`) The prompt to send. Must not be blank.
- `{opts?}` (`table?`) Optional fields: session (string) id of a live

  session; defaults to the focused one.


**Returns:** (`string|nil`, `string|nil`) "started" or "queued", or nil and an error.

**Example:**

```lua
local state, err = maki.session.prompt("run the tests", { session = id })
```

---

### `maki.session.notify()` {#maki-session-notify}

```lua
maki.session.notify({text}, {opts?})
```

Reports {text} to a live session without creating a user turn. The
observation waits for the session's next agent run.

**Parameters:**

- `{text}` (`string`) What to report. Must not be blank.
- `{opts?}` (`table`) Options:
  - `session` (`string`) id of a live session.
  - `wake` (`boolean`) start a TUI turn when it next becomes idle (default false).

**Returns:** (`boolean|nil`, `string|nil`) true, or nil and an error.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.session.notify("[monitor] deploy failed", { session = id, wake = true })
```

---

### `maki.session.set_mode()` {#maki-session-set_mode}

```lua
maki.session.set_mode({mode}, {opts?})
```

Switches a live session between plan and build mode. Entering plan mode
allocates the session's plan file if it has none.

A session that is mid-plan answers the next prompt with another draft of
the plan. Set `"build"` first and that prompt implements it.

**Parameters:**

- `{mode}` (`string`) "build" or "plan".
- `{opts?}` (`table?`) Options:
  - `session` (`string`) id of a live session, defaults to the focused one.

**Returns:** (`boolean|nil`, `string|nil`) true, or nil and an error.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.session.set_mode("build", { session = opts.session })
maki.session.prompt("Implement the plan at `" .. opts.path .. "`.", { session = opts.session })
```

---

### `maki.session.set_title()` {#maki-session-set_title}

```lua
maki.session.set_title({opts})
```

Renames a session, live or stored.

**Parameters:**

- `{opts}` (`table`) Required fields: id (string) session to rename;
  - `title` (`string`) the new title.

**Returns:** (`boolean|nil`, `string|nil`) true on success, or nil and an error.

**Example:**

```lua
local _, err = maki.session.set_title({ id = id, title = "refactor" })
```


## maki.Timer {#maki-Timer}

Handle returned by `maki.defer_fn`. Its `:stop()` cancels the
callback before it fires, which is what debouncing is built on.

---

### `Timer:stop()` {#Timer-stop}

```lua
Timer:stop()
```

Cancel the pending callback. Safe to call more than once, and does
nothing once the callback has already run.

**Example:**

```lua
local h = maki.defer_fn(function() rebuild() end, 300)
h:stop()
```


## maki.task {#maki-task}

The subagents of the focused session and their transcripts. Tasks are
spawned by the `task` tool and addressed by an id that survives a reload.
Without an interactive UI every function returns
`nil, "no interactive UI attached"`.

---

### `maki.task.list()` {#maki-task-list}

```lua
maki.task.list()
```

Lists the focused session's chats in chat order. Entry 1 is always the main
chat, with id `"main"` and no `status`: its work is the session's own, and
`maki.session.live()` already reports that. The rest are subagents, keyed by
the tool call that spawned them.

**Returns:** (`table|nil`, `string|nil`) Array of `{id, name, focused, status?}` where
  `status` is `"working"`, `"done"`, or `"error"`, or nil and an error.

**Example:**

```lua
for _, t in ipairs(maki.task.list() or {}) do
  print(t.name, t.status or "main")
end
```

---

### `maki.task.focus()` {#maki-task-focus}

```lua
maki.task.focus({id})
```

Shows a task's transcript, the way the chat cycling keys do. An id from
another session returns an error instead of landing on the wrong task.

**Parameters:**

- `{id}` (`string`) Task id, as returned by `list()`. `"main"` is the main chat.

**Returns:** (`boolean|nil`, `string|nil`) true on success, or nil and an error.

**Example:**

```lua
local _, err = maki.task.focus("main")
```


## maki.text {#maki-text}

Text utilities: format conversion and the fuzzy matcher the built-in
pickers use.

```lua
local md = maki.text.html_to_markdown(html)
local hits = maki.text.fuzzy_list("mrs", names, { limit = 10 })
```

---

### `maki.text.html_to_markdown()` {#maki-text-html_to_markdown}

```lua
maki.text.html_to_markdown({html})
```

Convert an HTML string to Markdown.
Useful for cleaning up web content fetched with `maki.webfetch`.

**Parameters:**

- `{html}` (`string`) HTML source text.

**Returns:** (`string?`, `string?`) Markdown text on success, or nil plus an error message.

**Example:**

```lua
local md, err = maki.text.html_to_markdown("<h1>Hello</h1><p>world</p>")
if err then return end
print(md) -- "# Hello\n\nworld"
```

---

### `maki.text.fuzzy()` {#maki-text-fuzzy}

```lua
maki.text.fuzzy({needle}, {haystack}, {opts?})
```

Scores {needle} against {haystack} with the fuzzy matcher the built-in
pickers use. {needle} is one pattern, spaces included.

Higher is better. Scores are only comparable across haystacks scored
against the same needle. An empty needle matches everything with score 0.

The second return value lists where the match landed, in the same shape
as `maki.fs.fuzzy_files`: 1-based inclusive `{ from, to }` byte ranges,
ascending, with adjacent characters merged. `haystack:sub(from, to)` is
the matched text.

Needs no plugin permission.

**Parameters:**

- `{needle}` (`string`) What the user typed.
- `{haystack}` (`string`) The candidate to score it against.
- `{opts?}` (`table?`) Options:
  - `paths` (`boolean`) rank {haystack} as a path, favouring the last segment, like the file picker. Off by default, like the model, command and list pickers.

**Returns:** (`integer|nil`, `table|nil`) Score and matched byte ranges, or nil when the needle does not match.

**Example:**

```lua
local score, at = maki.text.fuzzy("mrs", "maki-ui/src/main.rs", { paths = true })
if score then print(("maki-ui/src/main.rs"):sub(at[1][1], at[1][2])) end
```

---

### `maki.text.fuzzy_list()` {#maki-text-fuzzy_list}

```lua
maki.text.fuzzy_list({needle}, {haystacks}, {opts?})
```

Scores {needle} against every entry of {haystacks} and returns the
matches, best first.

Ties keep their input order, so candidates you pre-sorted (by mtime, say)
stay in that order for an empty needle. `index` is the 1-based position in
{haystacks}, and `highlights` uses the byte ranges of `fuzzy`. Entries
that are not valid UTF-8 are skipped.

To rank files, use `maki.fs.fuzzy_files` instead. It queries the index
the host already keeps, so no candidate list crosses into Lua.

Needs no plugin permission.

**Parameters:**

- `{needle}` (`string`) What the user typed.
- `{haystacks}` (`table`) Array of candidate strings.
- `{opts?}` (`table?`) Options:
  - `limit` (`integer`) keep at most this many results.
  - `paths` (`boolean`) rank candidates as paths, like the file picker. Off by default.
  - `highlights` (`boolean`) also return where the query matched, off by default since it costs a second pass.

**Returns:** (`table`) Array of `{ text, index, score, highlights? }`, best first.

**Example:**

```lua
for _, m in ipairs(maki.text.fuzzy_list(query, names, { limit = 10 })) do
  print(m.text, m.score)
end
```


## maki.treesitter {#maki-treesitter}

Tree-sitter parsing and query API.

Mirrors `vim.treesitter` from Neovim, so plugins can be shared between the two.
Start with `get_parser()` to parse source code, then use `get_node_text()` and
the `query` sub-module to extract information from the syntax tree.

```lua
local parser, err = maki.treesitter.get_parser(source, "lua")

```lua
maki.treesitter.is_in_node_range({node}, {line}, {col})
```

Checks whether the 0-based position ({line}, {col}) falls inside {node}.
Handy for cursor-position checks.

```

---

### `maki.treesitter.language.add()` {#maki-treesitter-language-add}

```lua
maki.treesitter.language.add({lang}, {opts?})

```

---

### `maki.treesitter.language.register()` {#maki-treesitter-language-register}

```lua
maki.treesitter.language.register({lang}, {filetype})
```

## maki.ui {#maki-ui}

Functions for building interactive UI. Create buffers to hold
content, open floating or split windows to display them, highlight
code, render markdown, and show status hints.

```lua
local buf = maki.ui.buf()
buf:line("hello from my plugin!")
local win = maki.ui.open_win(buf, { title = "Greeting", width = "50%", height = 5 })
```

Without a UI (`maki -p`, the sdk, ACP), buffers and the text helpers
still work. The calls that need a screen behave like this:

- `action`, `input`, and `input_edit` return `nil, "no interactive UI attached"`.
- `open_editor` returns -1.
- `flash` writes to the log.
- `open_win`, `set_status_hint`, and `set_window_title` have no effect.

---

### `maki.ui.buf()` {#maki-ui-buf}

```lua
maki.ui.buf({opts?})
```

Creates a new buffer for building UI content. The first buffer
created in a task becomes the "live" buffer, streamed to the UI while
the tool runs, which is what the tool's own output pane wants. A
float that opens during a tool call would take that spot away, so
create its buffer with `{ scratch = true }`. It matches nvim's
`nvim_create_buf(false, true)`.

**Parameters:**

- `{opts?}` (`table?`) Optional. `scratch` (boolean) keeps the buffer out of the live slot, default false.

**Returns:** ([`Buf`](#maki-ui-Buf)) Buffer handle.

**Example:**

```lua
-- The tool's output pane:
local out = maki.ui.buf()
out:line("hello world")

-- A float raised during a tool call needs its own buffer:
local toast = maki.ui.buf({ scratch = true })
toast:line("copied!")
```

---

### `maki.ui.theme_color()` {#maki-ui-theme_color}

```lua
maki.ui.theme_color({name})
```

Looks up a color the syntax theme names, such as "background",
"foreground" or "accent". For the styles the UI paints with, use
`maki.ui.theme_style`.

**Parameters:**

- `{name}` (`string`) Syntax theme color name, e.g. "accent" or "background".

**Returns:** (`string|nil`) "#rrggbb" for a truecolor theme, a palette index as a
  string like "4" when the theme names an ANSI color, or "default" for the
  terminal's own color. Nil only when the name is unknown. Every form can be
  passed straight to a span's `fg`/`bg`.

**Example:**

```lua
local accent = maki.ui.theme_color("accent")
if accent then
  buf:line({ { "note", { fg = accent, bold = true } } })
end
```

---

### `maki.ui.theme_style()` {#maki-ui-theme_style}

```lua
maki.ui.theme_style({name})
```

Looks up a named style from the current theme. The names are the ones a span
already takes as a string ("dim", "item_selected", "keybind_section",
"diff_old", ...), so `{ text, "dim" }` and `theme_style("dim")` paint the
same. Reach for the table when you need the parts, say to keep a style's
foreground over a background of your own.

**Parameters:**

- `{name}` (`string`) Style name, the same spelling a span accepts.

**Returns:** (`table|nil`) `{fg?, bg?, bold?, italic?, underline?, dim?,
  strikethrough?, reversed?}`, ready to use as a span style. Colors are
  spelled as in `maki.ui.theme_color`. Nil when the name is unknown, and an
  empty table when the theme leaves that style unset.

**Example:**

```lua
local sel = maki.ui.theme_style("item_selected")
local dim = maki.ui.theme_style("dim")
buf:line({ { "note", { fg = dim.fg, bg = sel.bg } } })
```

---

### `maki.ui.highlight()` {#maki-ui-highlight}

```lua
maki.ui.highlight({code}, {lang}, {opts?})
```

Syntax-highlights a chunk of source code. Returns a table of styled
lines that you can feed into a buffer. Each line is a list of
`{text, style}` spans where style is a `{fg, bold?, italic?, underline?}` table.

`fg` is "#rrggbb" for a truecolor theme, a palette index as a string like
"4" when the theme names an ANSI color, or "default" for the terminal's own
color. Pass the span straight to `buf:line` and it resolves correctly in
every case.

**Parameters:**

- `{code}` (`string`) Source text to highlight.
- `{lang}` (`string`) Language identifier, e.g. "rust", "python".
- `{opts?}` (`table?`) Options. Fields:
  - `independent` (`boolean`) highlight each line without cross-line context. Default false.
  - `prefix` (`string`) prepend to the source before highlighting (affects token context). Default "".

**Returns:** (`table`) Lines: `{ { {text, style}, ... }, ... }`. Each style is `{fg, bold?, italic?, underline?}`.

**Example:**

```lua
local lines = maki.ui.highlight("fn main() {}", "rust")
for _, spans in ipairs(lines) do
  buf:line(spans)
end
```

---

### `maki.ui.markdown()` {#maki-ui-markdown}

```lua
maki.ui.markdown({text}, {width})
```

Renders Markdown into styled lines ready to display in a buffer.
Each span's style is either a named string ("bold", "heading",
"inline_code", etc.) or a `{fg, bold?, italic?, underline?}` table
for syntax-highlighted code blocks.

**Parameters:**

- `{text}` (`string`) Markdown source.
- `{width}` (`integer`) Wrap width in columns.

**Returns:** (`table`) Lines: `{ { {text, style}, ... }, ... }`.

**Example:**

```lua
local size = maki.ui.terminal_size()
local lines = maki.ui.markdown("# Hello\n\nSome **bold** text.", size.cols)
for _, spans in ipairs(lines) do
  buf:line(spans)
end
```

---

```

---

### `maki.ui.flash()` {#maki-ui-flash}

```lua

```

Shows a short-lived message in the status bar, such as "copied!" or a
transient warning. Without a UI, the message goes to the log.

**Parameters:**

- `{msg}` (`string`) Message text.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.ui.flash("Copied to clipboard!")
```

---

### `maki.ui.action()` {#maki-ui-action}

```lua
maki.ui.action({name})
```

Runs a built-in UI action by name, exactly as its default keybinding
would. Handy when a default key never reaches maki because tmux or
your terminal grabs it first: bind a new key with `maki.keymap.set`
and call this from it.

Valid names: `"file_picker"`, `"search"`, `"help"`,
`"plan_toggle"`, `"plan_editor"`, `"edit_input"`, `"pop_queue"`,
`"prev_chat"`, `"next_chat"`, `"model_picker"`.

There is no action for sending the user's message. To take keys like
`<CR>` while a popup is open, use the `keys` option of `maki.ui.open_win`.

For slash commands rather than keybound actions, see
`maki.api.run_command`.

**Parameters:**

- `{name}` (`string`) Action name, e.g. `"file_picker"`.

**Returns:** (`boolean|nil`, `string|nil`) `true` on success, or nil and an error for an unknown name or a missing UI.

-- Open the built-in file picker with Ctrl+Q instead of Ctrl+S:
maki.keymap.set("n", "<C-q>", function()
  maki.ui.action("file_picker")
end)
```

---

### `maki.ui.open_editor()` {#maki-ui-open_editor}

```lua
maki.ui.open_editor({path})
```

Opens {path} in the user's `$EDITOR` (e.g. vim, nano) and suspends the
TUI until the editor exits. An exit code of 0 does not mean the user
saved: read the file back to see what changed.

**Parameters:**

- `{path}` (`string`) File to open.

**Returns:** (`integer`) Editor exit code, or -1 if the editor failed to start or there is no UI.

**Example:**

```lua
local code = maki.ui.open_editor("/tmp/scratch.lua")
if code ~= 0 then
  maki.ui.flash("editor exited with " .. code)
end
```

---

### `maki.ui.open_win()` {#maki-ui-open_win}

```lua
maki.ui.open_win({buf}, {opts})
```

Opens a floating or split window that displays the contents of {buf}.
Returns a Win handle you can use to receive events, update layout,
and close the window when you are done.

**Parameters:**

- `{buf}` ([`Buf`](#maki-ui-Buf)) Buffer to display.
- `{opts}` (`table`) Float configuration. Fields:
  - `width` (`integer|string`) window width. Integer for absolute columns; "N%" for percent of terminal width. Default "60%".
  - `height` (`integer|string`) window height. Integer for absolute rows; "N%" for percent of terminal height. Default "70%".
  - `row` (`integer?`) row offset from the anchor corner. Negative values move up.
  - `col` (`integer?`) column offset from the anchor corner.
  - `anchor` (`string`) corner the (row, col) offset is relative to. One of "NW" (default), "NE", "SW", "SE". Or "input_caret", which sits the window beside the chat input caret: the host takes the roomier side of the caret, trims the height to what fits there, keeps the whole width on screen, and re-places it every frame, so it follows wraps, resizes and any modal taking focus. `row` and `col` shift the window off that spot, and `stack` grows the next one away from the caret. With no caret on screen, because a form, a permission prompt or a `below` split has taken the input box, it falls back to the centred default, `row` and `col` still applying.
  - `border` (`string`) border style. One of "rounded" (default), "single", "double", "none".
  - `title` (`string`) text shown in the top border. Default "".
  - `title_pos` (`string`) title alignment. One of "left" (default), "center", "right".
  - `footer` (`table`) key-hint pairs shown in the bottom border. Each entry is {key, label}. A bordered float is widened to fit its title and footer, up to the screen width.
  - `zindex` (`integer`) stacking order. Default 50.
  - `cursor_line` (`boolean`) highlight the focused row. Default false.
  - `reserved_top` (`integer`) rows reserved at the top of the content area. Default 0.
  - `reserved_bottom` (`integer`) rows reserved at the bottom of the content area. Default 0.
  - `split` (`string`) dock the window to an edge instead of floating. One of "above", "below", "left", "right", "panel", or "" (floating, default).
  - `order` (`integer`) paint order among split windows at the same edge. Default 50.
  - `focus` (`boolean`) whether the window takes keyboard focus on open. Default true.
  - `keys` (`table`) keys this window takes while it is on screen, in `maki.keymap` notation, e.g. `{ "<Tab>", "<CR>" }`. Requires `focus = false`, since a focused window already gets every key. A claimed key goes to this window's `recv` and never reaches the chat input or `maki.keymap.set` bindings. Claims are released automatically when the window closes, and a hidden or zero-size window claims nothing. Host pickers and the slash command palette take keys first while open over the window. `<C-c>` and `<C-z>` are refused.
  - `visible` (`boolean`) whether the window is initially visible. Default true. See `win:hide()` for what hiding does.
  - `needs_input` (`boolean`) whether the window means the session needs user input. Default false.
  - `stack` (`boolean`) offset the window past the other stacked windows sharing its anchor, in open order, with a one row gap. Closing one moves the rest up. Floating windows only. Default false.

**Returns:** ([`Win`](#maki-ui-Win)) Window handle.

**Example:**

```lua
local buf = maki.ui.buf()
buf:line("Pick an option:")
local win = maki.ui.open_win(buf, {
  title = "Menu",
  width = "50%",
  height = 10,
  cursor_line = true,
  footer = { { "q", "quit" }, { "Enter", "select" } },
})
```

---

### `maki.ui.set_status_hint()` {#maki-ui-set_status_hint}

```lua
maki.ui.set_status_hint({spans})
```

Shows key hints in the status bar for your plugin. Each hint is a {key, label} pair. Pass nil to clear your plugin's hints. Only your own hints are affected, other plugins keep theirs.

**Parameters:**

- `{spans}` (`table|nil`) Sequence of {key, label} pairs, e.g. `{{"q", "quit"}, {"j", "down"}}`. Pass nil to remove the plugin's hints.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.ui.set_status_hint({ {"q", "quit"}, {"j", "down"} })
-- later, clear them:
maki.ui.set_status_hint(nil)
```

---

### `maki.ui.set_window_title()` {#maki-ui-set_window_title}

```lua
maki.ui.set_window_title({title})
```

Sets the terminal emulator's window title. Pass an empty string to
clear it.

The title passes through tmux, GNU screen, and zellij untouched, and
control characters are stripped, so model text cannot inject escape
sequences into the terminal. On exit maki hands the title back to the
shell, on terminals that support the title stack.

**Parameters:**

- `{title}` (`string`) New window title, e.g. `"● 3/5 tests"`.

**Example:**

```lua
maki.ui.set_window_title("maki: " .. session_name)
-- Give the title back to the shell:
maki.ui.set_window_title("")
```

---

### `maki.ui.input()` {#maki-ui-input}

```lua
maki.ui.input()
```

Reads the chat input text and the cursor position.

Offsets are byte offsets into `text`, the unit the Lua string library
indexes by, so `text:sub(1, cursor)` is everything before the cursor. A
newline counts as one byte.

The returned table has:

- `session_id` (string) the tab the value was read from. Pass it to
  `input_edit`, which refuses once another tab is focused.
- `text` (string) the whole value, newlines included.
- `cursor` (integer) byte offset of the cursor into `text`.
- `version` (integer) counter of changes to the value. Pass it to
  `input_edit`, which refuses once the value has moved on.

The cursor line and column are a slice of those two, so the table leaves
them out: with `local before = st.text:sub(1, st.cursor)`,
`select(2, before:gsub("\n", ""))` is the 0-based line and
`#before:match("[^\n]*$")` the byte column inside it.

To put a window on the caret, open it with `anchor = "input_caret"`. The
host re-places it every frame, so it follows wraps and resizes.

**Returns:** (`table|nil`, `string|nil`) The input state, or nil and an error.

**Example:**

```lua
local st = maki.ui.input()
local before = st.text:sub(1, st.cursor)
```

---

### `maki.ui.input_edit()` {#maki-ui-input_edit}

```lua
maki.ui.input_edit({opts})
```

Replaces a byte range of the chat input, as if the user had selected it
and typed {text}. The cursor lands after the inserted text unless you
say otherwise.

A handler runs after the key that woke it, so the user may have typed on
or switched tab in between. Five checks refuse the edit:

- `stop` past the end of the value.
- An offset inside a multi-byte character.
- `version` no longer current.
- `session_id` naming a tab that is not focused. Both guards are
  required and neither substitutes for the other: every tab counts
  versions from zero.
- A chat input the user cannot see, since text written there would be
  sent later without ever being read. A permission prompt, the plan form,
  a pack review, a `below` split, a finished subagent's chat and a
  terminal too short to give the box a text row all take it off screen,
  and a picker, a modal or a focused plugin window covers it.

Read again and retry on any of them.

Tabs and carriage returns in {text} become spaces and newlines, and the
other control characters are dropped, the way a paste is rewritten.

**Parameters:**

- `{opts}` (`table`) Options:
  - `start` (`integer`) byte offset the replaced range starts at.
  - `stop` (`integer`) byte offset it ends at. `start == stop` inserts.
  - `text` (`string`) what to put there, `""` to delete the range. Required, so a misspelled key cannot empty it by accident.
  - `version` (`integer`) the version `maki.ui.input` returned, which the offsets were planned against.
  - `session_id` (`string`) the session `maki.ui.input` read the offsets from.
  - `cursor` (`integer|nil`) byte offset to leave the cursor at, default is the end of the inserted text.

**Returns:** (`boolean|nil`, `string|nil`) `true` on success, or nil and an error.

**Example:**

```lua
local st = maki.ui.input()
-- Replace the "@src/ma" before the cursor with a full path:
maki.ui.input_edit({
  start = 8,
  stop = st.cursor,
  text = "src/main.rs",
  version = st.version,
  session_id = st.session_id,
})
```


## maki.ui.Win {#maki-ui-Win}

Handle to a floating or split window. You get one from
`maki.ui.open_win()`. Use `recv()` in a loop to handle keyboard
input, and call `close()` when done.

Fields: `width`, `height` (initial content dimensions in columns/rows),
`visible` (current visibility).

```lua
local win = maki.ui.open_win(buf, { title = "Demo" })
while true do
  local ev = win:recv()
  if not ev or ev.key == "q" then break end
end
win:close()
```

---

### `Win:recv()` {#Win-recv}

```lua
Win:recv({timeout_ms?})
```

Waits for the next event from this window. Call this in a loop to build an interactive UI. Returns nil once the window is closed or the channel disconnects. Pass {timeout_ms} to also get `{type="timeout"}` events so your plugin can animate while idle.

Event tables by type:
- `{type="key", key}` -- keypress. {key} is in canonical `maki.keymap` notation: `"q"`, `"<CR>"`, `"<Esc>"`, `"<C-n>"`, `"<S-Tab>"`.
- `{type="resize", width, height}` -- terminal was resized.
- `{type="paste", text}` -- bracketed paste.
- `{type="close"}` -- window was closed externally.
- `{type="timeout"}` -- no event arrived within {timeout_ms}.

**Parameters:**

- `{timeout_ms?}` (`integer`) Max milliseconds to wait before a timeout event is returned.

**Returns:** (`table|nil`) Event table, or nil if the window has closed.

**Example:**

```lua
while true do
  local ev = win:recv()
  if not ev or ev.key == "q" then break end
  if ev.type == "key" and ev.key == "<Down>" then
    -- move cursor down
  end
end
win:close()
```

---

### `Win:set_config()` {#Win-set_config}

```lua
Win:set_config({opts})
```

Updates the window layout on the fly. Only the fields you include in
{opts} are changed, everything else stays the same.

**Parameters:**

- `{opts}` (`table`) Partial float config. Accepted fields:
  - `title` (`string`) border title text.
  - `title_pos` (`string`) title alignment, "left", "center", or "right".
  - `footer` (`table`) key-hint pairs `{{key, label}, ...}` shown in the bottom border.
  - `border` (`string`) "rounded", "single", "double", or "none".
  - `anchor` (`string`) corner origin, "NW", "NE", "SW", "SE", or "input_caret".
  - `width` (`integer|string`) new width; integer or "N%".
  - `height` (`integer|string`) new height; integer or "N%".
  - `zindex` (`integer`) stacking order.
  - `cursor_line` (`boolean`) highlight the focused row.
  - `reserved_top` (`integer`) rows reserved at the top of the content area.
  - `split` (`string`) edge docking, "above", "below", "left", "right", "panel", or "".
  - `order` (`integer`) paint order among split windows.
  - `needs_input` (`boolean`) whether the window means the session needs user input.

**Example:**

```lua
win:set_config({ title = "Updated!", width = "80%" })
```

---

### `Win:set_cursor()` {#Win-set_cursor}

```lua
Win:set_cursor({row})
```

Moves the highlighted cursor line to {row} (1-indexed). Only has a
visible effect when the window was opened with `cursor_line = true`.

**Parameters:**

- `{row}` (`integer`) Target row, 1-indexed.

**Example:**

```lua
win:set_cursor(3) -- highlight the third line
```

---

### `Win:close()` {#Win-close}

```lua
Win:close()
```

Closes the window and frees its resources. Safe to call more than
once. The window also closes automatically when the handle is
garbage collected.

**Example:**

```lua
win:close()
```

---

### `Win:is_open()` {#Win-is_open}

```lua
Win:is_open()
```

Returns true if the window is still alive (not closed). Useful for
checking before sending commands.

**Returns:** (`boolean`) true if open.

**Example:**

```lua
if win:is_open() then
  win:set_config({ title = "still here" })
end
```

---

### `Win:show()` {#Win-show}

```lua
Win:show()
```

Makes the window visible again after it was hidden with `hide()`.

**Example:**

```lua
win:show()
```

---

### `Win:hide()` {#Win-hide}

```lua
Win:hide()
```

Hides the window without closing it. The window keeps its state
and buffer contents. Call `show()` to bring it back.

A hidden window of any kind takes no space, draws nothing and claims no
keys. It still accepts commands and reports events.

**Example:**

```lua
win:hide()
-- do some work...
win:show()
```

---

### `Win:is_visible()` {#Win-is_visible}

```lua
Win:is_visible()
```

Returns true if the window is both open and visible (not hidden).

**Returns:** (`boolean`) true if visible.


## maki.ui.Buf {#maki-ui-Buf}

A content buffer that holds styled lines of text. Create one with
`maki.ui.buf()` and pass it to `maki.ui.open_win()` to show it in
a floating or split window.

```lua
local buf = maki.ui.buf()
buf:line("hello")
buf:line({ { "world", "bold" } })
```

---

### `Buf:line()` {#Buf-line}

```lua
Buf:line({line})
```

Appends a single line to the end of the buffer. You can pass a
plain string for unstyled text, or a table of `{text, style?}` spans
for rich content. Style can be a named string like "bold" or
"keyword", or an inline table `{fg?, bg?, bold?, italic?, underline?, dim?, strikethrough?, reversed?}`.
Colors accept "#rrggbb", a terminal color name like "blue" or "light-gray",
or a palette index as a string like "4". Names must be spelled exactly,
hyphens included. Named and indexed colors are left for the terminal to
resolve, so they follow the user's palette. To mix a named style with colors
of your own, `maki.ui.theme_style` hands back its parts.

**Parameters:**

- `{line}` (`string|table`) Plain string, or a sequence of spans: `{ {text, style?}, ... }`.

**Example:**

```lua
buf:line("plain text")
buf:line({ { "ERROR", { fg = "#ff0000", bold = true } }, { " something broke" } })
```

---

### `Buf:lines()` {#Buf-lines}

```lua
Buf:lines({lines})
```

Appends several lines at once. Each entry uses the same format as
`buf:line()`, so you can mix plain strings and styled spans.

**Parameters:**

- `{lines}` (`table`) Sequence of line values, each the same format accepted by `buf:line`.

**Example:**

```lua
buf:lines({
  "first line",
  { { "styled ", "bold" }, { "second line" } },
  "third line",
})
```

---

### `Buf:set_lines()` {#Buf-set_lines}

```lua
Buf:set_lines({lines})
```

Replaces every line in the buffer with {lines}. Use this when you
want to redraw the whole buffer, for example after the user toggles
a view.

**Parameters:**

- `{lines}` (`table`) Sequence of line values, each the same format accepted by `buf:line`.

**Example:**

```lua
buf:set_lines({ "new content", "replaces everything" })
```

---

### `Buf:len()` {#Buf-len}

```lua
Buf:len()
```

Returns how many lines the buffer currently holds.

**Returns:** (`integer`) Line count.

**Example:**

```lua
if buf:len() == 0 then
  buf:line("(empty)")
end
```

---

### `Buf:get_lines()` {#Buf-get_lines}

```lua
Buf:get_lines()
```

Returns all lines in the buffer as a Lua table. Each line is a
sequence of `{text, style?}` spans, the same format `buf:line()`
accepts. Useful for reading back content, copying it to another
buffer, or round-tripping through `set_lines()`.

**Returns:** (`table`) Sequence of lines.

**Example:**

```lua
local lines = buf:get_lines()
buf:set_lines(lines) -- round-trip
```

---

### `Buf:on()` {#Buf-on}

```lua
Buf:on({event}, {callback})
```

Registers an event handler on the buffer.

Supported events:
- "click": fires when the user clicks a line. The handler receives
  a click-event table and may yield or mutate the buffer.
- "change": fires synchronously after every mutation (`line`,
  `lines`, `set_lines`). Must not yield.

Calling `on()` again for the same event replaces the previous handler.

**Parameters:**

- `{event}` (`string`) Event name: "click" or "change".
- `{callback}` (`function`) Handler function. For "click", receives a click-event table. For "change", receives no arguments.

**Example:**

```lua
buf:on("click", function(ev)
  maki.ui.flash("Clicked row " .. ev.row)
end)
```

---

### `Buf:click()` {#Buf-click}

```lua
Buf:click({ev})
```

Programmatically fires the buffer's click handler with event {ev}.
Does nothing if no click handler is registered. Useful for testing
or simulating user interaction from code.

**Parameters:**

- `{ev}` (`table`) Click event table passed to the handler.

**Example:**

```lua
buf:click({ row = 1 })
```

---

### `Buf:blit()` {#Buf-blit}

```lua
Buf:blit({fb}, {width}, {height}, {opts?})
```

Replaces the whole buffer with a pixel frame drawn as `"▀"` cells.
Each cell's foreground is the top pixel and its background the
bottom one, so one text line fits two pixel rows. When {height} is
odd the last line leaves its background unset and the terminal
default shows through.

{fb} is a Luau `buffer` of raw pixel bytes in row-major order,
top-left origin. Its size must be exactly
`width * height * bytes_per_pixel` for the chosen format, otherwise
the call throws. A mismatch usually means a wrong width or format,
and an early error beats hunting down a garbled frame.

Formats: "rgb" is the default at 3 bytes per pixel. "rgba" and
"bgra" take 4 bytes per pixel and ignore the 4th byte. "bgra" is
what a little-endian `uint32` holding `0xRRGGBB` looks like in
memory, the layout doomgeneric uses for its framebuffer.

`char` swaps the `"▀"` glyph for another one column wide string,
e.g. `"█"` when only the foreground color should show. The
foreground still comes from the top pixel and the background from
the bottom one, whatever the glyph.

**Parameters:**

- `{fb}` (`buffer`) Raw pixel bytes.
- `{width}` (`integer`) Frame width in pixels, > 0.
- `{height}` (`integer`) Frame height in pixels, > 0.
- `{opts?}` (`table|nil`) Options: `format` = "rgb"|"rgba"|"bgra", `char` = one column wide string.

**Example:**

```lua
local fb = buffer.create(160 * 100 * 3)
buffer.writeu8(fb, (y * 160 + x) * 3, 255) -- red channel
buf:blit(fb, 160, 100)
buf:blit(fb32, 160, 100, { format = "bgra", char = "█" })
```


## maki.uv {#maki-uv}

System and environment utilities, modelled after `vim.uv`.

Provides access to the working directory, home directory, and environment
variables. None of these functions throw.

Filesystem location queries (`cwd`, `os_homedir`) need `fs_read`, while
`os_getenv` reads the process environment, where secrets live, so it needs
`env`.

```lua
local home = maki.uv.os_homedir()
```

---

### `maki.uv.cwd()` {#maki-uv-cwd}

```lua
maki.uv.cwd()
```

Return the current working directory as an absolute path. Like `vim.uv.cwd`.

Requires the `fs_read` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Returns:** (`string?`) Current working directory, or nil if it cannot be determined.

**Example:**

```lua
local cwd = maki.uv.cwd()
if cwd then print("working in: " .. cwd) end
```

---

### `maki.uv.os_homedir()` {#maki-uv-os_homedir}

```lua
maki.uv.os_homedir()
```

Return the current user's home directory. Like `vim.uv.os_homedir`.

Requires the `fs_read` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Returns:** (`string?`) Home directory path, or nil if it cannot be determined.

**Example:**

```lua
local home = maki.uv.os_homedir() -- e.g. "/home/user"
```

---

### `maki.uv.os_getenv()` {#maki-uv-os_getenv}

```lua
maki.uv.os_getenv({name})
```

Look up the environment variable {name}. Like `vim.uv.os_getenv`.
Returns nil when the variable is not set.

Requires the `env` [plugin permission](#plugin-permissions).

**Parameters:**

- `{name}` (`string`) Name of the environment variable.

**Returns:** (`string?`) Variable value, or nil if not set.

**Example:**

```lua
local editor = maki.uv.os_getenv("EDITOR") or "vi"
```


## maki.yaml {#maki-yaml}

YAML encoding and decoding. Works the same way as `maki.json`,
but for YAML formatted strings.

```lua
local t = maki.yaml.decode("greeting: hello")
print(t.greeting)
```

---

### `maki.yaml.encode()` {#maki-yaml-encode}

```lua
maki.yaml.encode({value})
```

Turn a Lua value into a YAML string. Most Lua types work, but
circular references will return an error.

**Parameters:**

- `{value}` (`any`) Lua value to encode.

**Returns:** (`string?`, `string?`) YAML string, or nil plus an error.

**Example:**

```lua
local s, err = maki.yaml.encode({ name = "maki", tags = { "ai", "agent" } })
print(s)
```

---

### `maki.yaml.decode()` {#maki-yaml-decode}

```lua
maki.yaml.decode({str})
```

Parse a YAML string into a Lua value. Mappings become tables and
sequences become 1-indexed arrays.

**Parameters:**

- `{str}` (`string`) YAML string to decode.

**Returns:** (`any?`, `string?`) Decoded value, or nil plus an error.

**Example:**

```lua
local t, err = maki.yaml.decode("name: maki\nversion: 1")
print(t.name) -- maki
```


## Shared helper modules

These ship inside maki; `require` them from any plugin. Small modules are
shown as full source, larger ones as their public interface.

### `require("maki.color")`

```lua
local M = {}

function M.lerp(from, to, t)
  local fr, fg, fb = from:match("^#(%x%x)(%x%x)(%x%x)$")
  local tr, tg, tb = to:match("^#(%x%x)(%x%x)(%x%x)$")
  if not fr or not tr then
    return nil
  end
  fr, fg, fb = tonumber(fr, 16), tonumber(fg, 16), tonumber(fb, 16)
  tr, tg, tb = tonumber(tr, 16), tonumber(tg, 16), tonumber(tb, 16)
  local r = math.floor(fr + (tr - fr) * t + 0.5)
  local g = math.floor(fg + (tg - fg) * t + 0.5)
  local b = math.floor(fb + (tb - fb) * t + 0.5)
  return string.format("#%02x%02x%02x", r, g, b)
end

function M.dim(color, factor)
  local background = maki.ui.theme_style("background")
  local bg = background and background.bg
  return bg and M.lerp(color, bg, factor)
end

return M
```

### `require("maki.dir_listing")`

```lua
-- Shared directory listing for index and list plugins, so every caller
-- shows a directory the same way. Listing also loads the directory's
-- instruction files onto the call.
function M.list(path, ctx)
function M.view(text, ctx)
```

### `require("maki.fuzzy_replace")`

```lua
M.NO_MATCH = "old_string not found in file"
M.MULTIPLE_MATCHES = "old_string matches multiple locations; add surrounding context to make it unique"
M.EMPTY_OLD_STRING = "old_string must not be empty"

-- Replace {old_string} with {new_string} in {content}, tolerating small
-- whitespace and indentation drift. Returns the new content, or nil plus
-- one of the error constants above.
function M.replace(content, old_string, new_string, replace_all)
```

### `require("maki.list_picker")`

```lua
-- Draws the filter query and its blank spacer into {lines}, pins that height on
-- {win} and returns it, which is also the first scrollable line. Drawing and
-- pinning belong together: a query that wraps, or one pasted with a newline,
-- makes the header taller than a picker would guess, and a reserved_top guessed
-- elsewhere then mis-scrolls the list.
function ListPicker.render_header(win, lines, input, prefix, inner)

-- Open a fuzzy-filter picker in a floating window and block until the user
-- decides.
--
-- {items} is a list of strings or of
-- { label, detail?, section?, section_detail? } tables. A detail is a string, or
-- a list of { text, style } parts when the right of a row needs more than one
-- color. Mark one part `elastic = true` and that is the part a narrow row cuts,
-- leaving the parts after it whole.
--
-- {opts}:
--   title, footer, cursor (initial index)
--   submit_keys: extra submit keys besides <CR>
--   action_keys: keys that close the picker and report themselves, like { "R" }
--     for a refresh binding. Use uppercase keys, lowercase ones keep feeding
--     the filter
--   live_keys: { [key] = function(item|nil) -> items|nil }, keys that swap the
--     list in place, keeping the typed query. Called with the selected item, or
--     nil when nothing matches, and returning nil leaves the list alone.
--     Handlers run inside the render loop, so keep them cheap and hand anything
--     slow to an action_key
--   key: function(item) -> string|nil, a row's identity. Rows sharing the
--     selected row's key are tinted, and the cursor follows its key across a
--     live swap

-- cannot drift apart.

function M.extend(spec)

--- Returns max_lines, max_bytes: tool override when set, agent-wide otherwise.

--- lines here rather than terminate them, so a trailing one is an empty last
--- line and counts as one.
function M.tail(text, n)
```

### `require("maki.partial")`

```lua
-- When a tool is cut short, it still hands back what it printed. The marker
-- tells the model that output is real but unfinished. One home for the
-- wording and the painting, so every tool says it the same way.

--- Close {view} on the marker and build the tool reply. {out} is everything
--- the tool streamed, already truncated; empty means the view still shows a
--- placeholder to drop. {reason} is a cancel-hook reason ("cancelled" |
--- "timeout").

### `require("maki.provider_parse")`

```lua

-- and in an array it stops `ipairs`. Numbers above 2^53 come back rounded.

--- A whole, non-negative number up to 2^64, or nil.
function M.as_u64(value)

--- A whole, non-negative number that fits a u32, or nil.
function M.as_u32(value)

--- A boolean, or nil.
function M.as_bool(value)

--- A model row's `pricing`, converted from per-token to per-million-token
--- dollars. Nil unless both `input` and `output` are given, so a partial price
--- never reads as free. A missing cache price is 0.
function M.pricing(input, output, cache_write, cache_read)

--- Maps each `body.data` element through `parse_row`, drops nils, keeps the
--- first row per id, and sorts by id. Returns an empty list when `data` is

### `require("maki.test_helpers")`

```lua

### `require("maki.text_input")`

```lua
-- TextInput: multi-line editable buffer with a byte-offset cursor.
--
-- Invariants enforced everywhere:
--   * `line` is 1-based and indexes a line that always exists.
--   * `col` is a byte offset inside `lines[line]`, always on a UTF-8 codepoint
--     boundary, so `lines[line]:sub(1, col)` is a complete UTF-8 prefix.
--   * No line ever contains a literal newline; newlines split into rows.
--
-- Parents OWN their keys. `handle_key` returns one of R.IGNORED / R.MOVED /
-- R.CHANGED. Parent dispatchers must filter their own keys (`<Esc>`, `<C-c>`,
-- submit keys, etc.) BEFORE forwarding, because `handle_key` claims any key
-- it can interpret. `<C-a>` is bound to move-home, so a parent that wants it
-- for "select all" must intercept first.
--
-- Keys are in canonical notation, as `win:recv` delivers them. Splitting a
-- line is the `input:split_line()` method rather than a pseudo-key, so every
-- key in KEYMAP is one a terminal can send.
--
-- IGNORED is returned when the buffer literally cannot act (backspace at
-- (1, 0), right at end of buffer, etc.). Parents can use that signal to fall
-- through to their own logic.
--
-- Parity cases live in plugins/lib/tests/spec.lua (TRACE_CASES). Add one
-- whenever you change handle_key semantics.

### `require("maki.toast")`

```lua

### `require("maki.tool_view")`

```lua
-- The shared truncate/expand body that tool plugins render through.
--
-- Click handlers get `ev.row`, a 1-based line in this buf; 0 means the
-- click landed outside it (the header). The handler lives on the buf
-- itself, so any wrapper of the same buf (a batch child's foreign handle)
-- reaches the same toggle. Expansion is never stored: the UI records
-- clicked rows and replays them through `restore` in order, so `toggle`
-- stays a pure flag flip + re-render, deterministic across replays.
-- Async highlighting goes through `maki.async.run`; during restore the
-- runtime runs those tasks inline before snapshotting.

-- Right aligned, so the content column stays put when a number gains a digit.
-- Formats the number alone, callers add their own separator.
function ToolView.line_nr_fmt(max_line_nr)
