# CONTRIBUTING

Thanks for taking an interest in contributing to maki.

Just remember I'd like to keep the project minimal to not become bloat - think if some functionality you need can be done as a Lua plugin, and if not, think about the Lua APIs you need in order to implement the plugin. Do these APIs exist in neovim? If so, shoot up a PR. If the APIs don't exist, open an issue about it, let's discuss.

When opening an issue, validate there is no open / closed issue talking about the exact thing you want to post about.

Regarding AI use in PRs, describe how you used AI, even include the prompts if unsure.

Useful commands are in the `justfile` file, most useful probably is `just ci` that runs locally basically everything we run in the CI automatically to block PRs. Run `just hooks` once after cloning so every commit checks formatting locally.

When bumping a dependency, prefer a release that has been out for at least 7 days; security fixes and targeted bugfixes can go in the same day. Dependabot opens the routine ones.

Releases are cut by pushing a tag; the full procedure and its failure modes are in docs/runbooks/release.md.

Rebuilds are slow mostly because of the linker, so dev builds skip debug info for the dependencies and for the C we build from source (`profile.dev.build-override` is where `cc` picks up `-g`). Our own crates keep theirs, so debugging maki feels the same as always, and if you ever want to step into a dependency, add `[profile.dev.package.<name>] debug = true`, or comment out `[profile.dev.package."*"]` in `Cargo.toml` to get all of them back.

My most useful prompts:

```
- go over the last commit and simplify - KISS, DRY, SRP, minimize bloat, remove unnecessary state (variables, fields, arguments), protect from state explosion. use steelman to argue each change. all this without omitting critical functionality.
- go over the tests in the last commit and simplify, consolidate tests, remove bullshit tests, make them less prone to break due to code / implementation changes / timing issues (sleeps on slow machines). use steelman to argue each change.
- remove trivial comments in the last commit, also modify the comments you do keep to explain concisely WHY on non obvious stuff, not WHAT. remove bloat (every comment paragraph should be justified). tone and language: down to earth, warm, concise (without omitting the non obvious / novel / interesting details), simple and easy to read even for non english natives, tell it in a story! no em-dashes, do not show it was written by AI.
- review the plan for being a scalable, rigid, easy to maintain, easy to fix, easy to add features, simple to reason about and understand, easy to fix at 2am in a year, I want this part of the code to be the most robust part of our code. Eliminate classes of bugs with a better design, not just squashing some bug. Aim for single source of truth. Fix & edit all the issues & concerns in plan file in-place (if there are any).
- review the last commit for being a scalable, rigid, easy to maintain, easy to fix, easy to add features, simple to reason about and understand, easy to fix at 2am in a year, I want this part of the code to be the most robust part of our code. Eliminate classes of bugs with a better design, not just squashing some bug. Aim for single source of truth. Fix all the issues & concerns (if there are any).
- commit in the same styling as others in history. tone and language: down to earth, concise (without omitting the non obvious / novel / interesting details), simple and easy to read even for non english natives, tell it in a story, no em-dashes, do not show it was written by AI. CONCISE, 2-5 sentences!! few word do trick
- run verification of no breakage of the last commit, run 3 smart parallel subagents, each with a completely different style of prompt, one creative, one more scrutinizing, think of the most apprioriate third one, so we'll have the best chance to find all the issues
- X is sphagetti, refactor it so it will be a scalable, rigid, easy to maintain, easy to fix, easy to add features, simple to reason about and understand, easy to fix at 2am in a year, I want this part of the code to be the most robust part of our code. Eliminate classes of bugs with a better design.
